Run for checkpoints, replan on the fly as the map changes, and duck for cover as our patrolling guards close in. Or take it more strategically, rack your brains to solve our cryptic clues, and keep your eyes open for bonus points.\n\nHowever you play, you can watch the live scoreboard for updates and battle it out with nearby teams. With a huge range of strategies, approaches, and levels, you can take this as casually or competitively as you want.\n\nPlease note: this game will require a data-enabled phone for scoring. Bring a team of up to 4 players!\n\nFor more info and tickets: https://citydash.fire-hazard.net/",

It began when more and more tech companies moved into San Francisco, a slew of IPOs came about with subsequent new millionaires, free busing enabled SF-based employees to travel to the Valley easily, and the overall incomes of tech employees became staggeringly higher in comparison.\n\nThe reality is that technology companies and their employees are not responsible for all of the ills that have affected our fantastic city. There are many in the tech community aiming to make a difference. And there are many more that want to understand how they can help their local community, and just need guidance. \n\nWe are bringing together leaders in the San Francisco community and technology industry to discuss some of the most pressing challenges facing our city right now: Affordable housing, the homeless population, the technology gap, children in poverty and workforce development. The goal is to paint a clear picture of these challenges and offer ways in which the technology community can assist. \n\nPlease join us! Food and drinks provided. \n\nEVENT DETAILS\nDate: September 24, 2014\n\nLocation: Twitter headquarters, 1355 Market Street\n\nTime: 6:00 pm reception, 6:45 pm panel, 8:00 pm conclusion\n\nEVENT TIMELINE\n6:45 pm: Opening: We need a one-city approach to San Francisco\u201d\n\n7:00 pm: Panel\nModerator: Sarah Austin: Pop17, YMCA Board of Directors\n\nPanel Members: \n- Kim Mai Cutler, Techcrunch\n- Mark Horvath: Founder, Invisible People\n- Bevan Dufty: Office of the Mayor/HOPE for the City\n- Chuck Collins, CEO, YMCA San Francisco\n\n7:45 pm: Audience questions\n\n8:00 pm: Event concludes\n\nBrought to you by:\nShih Yu-Lang Central YMCA\nSarah Austin\nMeeker Quinn",

        "description": "Hitting all the right notes with fans and peers alike, Russian sensation ARTY is the darling of the EDM world. An emerging titan in the studio and simply electrifying in the booth, support comes from all possible corners \u2013 Armin Van Buuren, Skrillex, Avicii, Tiesto, Above & Beyond, Axwell, SHM, Dirty South, Porter Robinson and more join the plethora of press touting ARTY as one of the biggest rising stars of recent years.From broadcasting behemoths MTV and Sirius XM and music bible Rolling Stone through to influential tastemakers Dancing Astronaut and beyond, watch ARTY build on this in 2012 as he continues to forge his path and takes his place amongst the dance music elite.The gifted youngster first lit up airwaves and dance floors back in 2009 with tracks such as \u2018Gentle Touch\u2019, \u2018Get On\u2019 and \u2018Flip Flop\u2019. Quickly snapped up by the legendary Anjunabeats imprint, his relationship with the team behind Above & Beyond has only gone from strength to strength over the last three years. Explosive anthems have proved to be the norm for Arty; \u2018Kate\u2019, \u2018Around The World\u2019, the Axtone-signed \u2018Trio\u2019 and the explosive Mat Zo collaboration \u2018Mozart\u2019 being the mere tip of a rapidly expanding musical iceberg. Consistently featured in the sets of the world\u2019s biggest artists and on its most far-reaching radio stations, it came as no surprise then that 2011\u2019s DJ Mag Top 100 DJ Poll saw ARTY soar a staggering 50+ places to claim the #25 spot.It\u2019s not just his continual onslaught of production work that sealed the deal for the army of ARTY fans who put their money where their mouth is and delivered votes in their droves. \n\nWhether it\u2019s deep in the darkened, thundering bosom of clubland or in front of tens of thousands on the laser-lit stages of Ultra Music Festival, Identity Festival, Electric Zoo Festival, Fallout Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival and more, his spell- binding sets have cemented his status as one of the most sought after artists anywhere. From the US and Canada through to South America, across the seas to the shores of Europe, Asia and beyond to Australia, this hot talent has grabbed the attention of both the new EDM generation and those more seasoned veterans of the dance arena. The chant seized on by fans says it all; there is \u201cno party without ARTY\u201d. And the success continues across the board. In June 2012, ARTY announced the beginning of a new partnership with Stateside radio giant Sirius XM. Joining the elite ranks of DJs to have hosted exclusive shows on the network, ARTY\u2019s \u2018Together We Are\u2019 will beam directly into the ears of a waiting America. \u2018Open Space\u2019, released on Anjunabeats in June, scored huge radio play and an overwhelming tidal wave of support from the likes of David Guetta, Axwell, Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, Hardwell, Thomas Gold, Gareth Emery, Ferry Corsten, Kaskade, Max Vangeli and more. As ARTY\u2019s profile continues to grow, as more and more tune in to his sound, the only question is how far and how high this young talented artist can go. \n\nhttps://.facebook.com/artyofficial\nhttps://soundcloud.com/artyofficial\nhttps://twitter.com/arty_music",

Feel free to use this Facebook invite!\nIf you've never been to the Joost House and would like to know where it is, please just put here and we'll send it to you in a private message. \n\nSo what is a BenchMark, anyways?\n\nBenchMarks are a fun way to get to know people, even if you've been friends with them for years. Imagine going to a party, but instead of the usual \"How's it going\" \"What do you do for work,\" type of questions, you got to ask anything that you were interested in. BenchMarks aim to get below the surface and have people really get to know each other.\n\nA BenchMark is a structured social evening that is comprised of 4 different games based around communication. Through these games, people can give and get as much attention as they want, find out about more about the other people there, and let people get to know them, too-- if they so choose.\n\nBenchMarks are about having fun, meeting new people, getting connected with community, expanding communication skills, and much more!",

        "description": "EDDIE ROBERTS & POSITIVE LEGACY PRESENT:\nTHE PAYBACK\n\nA benefit for Compass Family Services supporting San Francisco\u2019s Vulnerable and Homeless Families for the last 100 years\n\nTickets available at http://eddierobertspayback.com/  \n\nVIP ticket includes: balcony seating, vinyl of New Mastersounds \"Therapy\" and a signed/numbered poster of the event\n\nWHY A BENEFIT? \n\nEddie Roberts, guitarist and leader of The New Mastersounds, having lived for a period of time in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco felt a real sense of connection and community and was personally touched by the homeless situation, including the ignorance of the reality surrounding the issue. Eddie wishes to join his music with artists and organizations that are working to make a real difference in the lives of others. In September 2013, Eddie coordinated The Payback with The New Mastersounds, a night in support of the Coalition on Homelessness at the GAMH in San Francisco. Eddie and his band are continuing their efforts this year by supporting Compass Family Services, an organization that is providing tangible services and solutions to those in San Francisco that are homeless and at risk for becoming homeless.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO FACTS ON HOMELESSNESS: \n\n*Family homelessness has increased 20 percent in the past 4 years\n\n*Average wait for a family to get into temporary shelter is over 8 months\n\n*A single parent with 2 children must work 3 full-time, minimum wage jobs to afford basic living expenses\n\n*3,800 low-income children are on the waiting list for subsidized child care\n\nCOMPASS FAMILY SERVICES ACCOMPLISHMENTS: \n\n*95 percent of families in Compass housing programs don't return to shelters\n\n*3,500 parents and children benefit from our education, employment, and housing services every year\n\n*More than 1,000 children have graduated from our early childhood education programs prepared for success in kindergarten and beyond\n\n*We provide 12,700 nights of shelter for families annually\n\n*Through over 30,000 case management sessions each year, we help families become and remain self-sufficient\n\nTHE NEW MASTERSOUNDS: \n\nUK Funk & Groove Jam Band, The New Mastersounds recently celebrated their 10 year anniversary playing and touring in the USA. They also released their 9th studio album earlier this year, Therapy. The New Mastersounds are at the very top of an elite selection of acts that bring the true soul out of funk. As an example of the respect this band commands, Peter Wermelinger - DJ, collector, and author of the crate-diggers' bible The Funky & Groovy Music Lexicon - places the 2001 NMS track Turn This Thing Around in his all-time top-ten tunes, along with the likes of Eddie Harris, Funkadelic, and Herbie Hancock.\n\nAs a band, and as individuals, they have collaborated with an impressive array of musicians, DJs and producers, including Lou Donaldson, Corinne Bailey Rae, Page McConnell, Karl Denson, Melvin Sparks, George Porter Jr, Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker & Pee Wee Ellis (JB Horns), Ernest Ranglin, Art Neville, Nightmares on Wax & Pretty Lights.\n\nTHE NTH POWER: \n\nThe exceptional new project of Nigel Hall (Lettuce / Warren Haynes) on Vocals and Drummer Nikki Glaspie (Dumpsterphunk / Beyonce) proving that soul music can be exponentially greater than the sum of its parts, The Nth Power will inspire you to dance, groove, make love or just stand there with goose bumps. Few artists pack as much punch in a five-piece, all-analog ensemble as The Nth Power. The formula starts with drummer Nikki Glaspie's deep pocket, explosive energy and silky vocals, compounded by bassist Nate Edgar (John Brown's Body), whose quiet confidence lies in perfect contrast to the emphatic, funky low-end he creates. Next, the unmistakable vocals of Nigel Hall and his innate ability to preach with a keyboard hit the groove in full force. Over the top comes Nick Cassarino (Jennifer Hartswick Band, The Shift), oozing more soul in one finger than most guitarists could create in a lifetime, and with a voice that immediately wraps the room in sex appeal. West African djembe master Weedie Braimah (Toubab Krewe, Kreative Pandemonium) is the final X-factor, creating a rhythmic symphony that completes the equation with resounding finesse. Together, The Nth Power wants to change lives through a message of musical love and understanding.\n\nPOSITIVE LEGACY:\n\nPositive Legacy is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization whose mission is to integrate music and service to benefit people and the environment. Working in conjunction with Cloud 9 Adventures (Jam Cruise, Holy Ship, Mayan Holidays etc) , partner organizations, artists and a collective of creative leaders in the music industry, \nPositive Legacy coordinates environmental and \nhumanitarian service projects.",

We have created a monthly variety show, \"Tuesday's Child On Wednesday\"  that consists of Spoken word, storytelling, comedy and music. Each show is exciting and new as Morgan and Aziz search far and wide for world-class talent.\n\nSo far we've garnered much enthusiasm and interest in the process. And would like to make it a  regular offering of weekly shows of the community's choice.\nOur time as neighbors and business owners has heightened  our awareness of the amount of Artists and Musicians living in Bernal and made us aware how desperately the neighborhood needs a local venue to display such talents.\nHelp Us.... Help You\nIn order to have a  weekly show we need city permits.... and the city of San Francisco requires you to be a professionally trained circus animal jumping through numerous hoops. So...\nWe are seeking $5,000  In the hope of covering  the cost of permit processing, fees and equipment.\n    Official formal notification to neighbors of the permit application and all that it encompasses, fire codes, noise ordinance, capacity ordinances ....etc\n And,\n     A Sound system and stage equipment consisting of: a spotlight, microphones, speakers, curtains, amplifier and stage.\nWe feel in these times that the arts are fading away and classic entertainment  is becoming more out of reach. We see this as an opportunity to build community about arts awareness of all mediums, acceptance and tolerance.\nWe really want to reach our goal. However if we fall short, whatever funding we get will go directly to the permit process and the subsequent items we will slowly accumulate over time to make the show the very best it can be. \nThe Show will go on...Because we believe in the arts and what we do, and our Community Bernal Heights!\n\n\n\nThis is What You Get:\nHaving a local show just steps from your home will foster community fun on a weekly basis. Allowing Adults a place to gather and have a laid back evening out.\nThe shows that we will offer greatly depend on you and what you wish to see. Although we currently have a show that covers many ideas and mediums, here are a few thoughts of possible shows:\nTrivia night/Game night\nOpen mic ( just words or just music)\nDance Hall\nYearly Talent show\nNew Years Eve Cabaret show\nWe welcome your ideas via online and in person... you know where to find us!\nHere's a little about us:\nMorgan has over 8 years as a standingup story teller, has produced a year long show with Lauren Kraut \"Life with Laughter\" and has had a successful indiegogo campaign , \" The Girl Junk Tour and Documentary\" and is currently producing \"Tuesday's Child on Wednesday \" alongside her co producers Aziz and Monique.\n\n Aziz is the super friendly and very kind proprietor of Moonlight Cafe and has been acting for over 10 years in various forms of improv, comedy,  drama and film.\n\nMonique beautifies the Neighborhood and generates community through the many hats she wears as Heartfelt manager, student, and Bernal Library Art Project founding member. She is ever supportive of the Arts, originally introducing morgan and Aziz to each other.\n\nRisks & Challenges\nWe are most concerned with the permit process and city support because its not a guarantee unless we have neighborhood support and city and county permission. If our permit is not granted, no money is refunded and we will have to keep                re-applying, each time paying a new application fee.\nIf we don't get permitted we will not be able to have a show.\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nShout it out!  Please tell everyone you know!\nIf you love the Arts, comedy, music, spoken word, storytelling and are supportive of building community....please share this with everyone.\n\n\nAnd that's all there is to it.\n\nSEE YOU AT THE SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Her original songs are lush and heartfelt, ripe with thoughtful lyrics and always a few musical twists and turns. Highly-influenced by the music of Joni Mitchell, Rebecca has also been compared to contemporary folk/rock cross-over phenoms such as Patty Griffin, Becca Stevens, Grace Potter and Sara Bareilles.\n\nLera Lynn, fresh off the release of her album, The Avenues, has received accolades from noteworthy sources such as The New York Times, The Boston Globe and American Songwriter. She's been described as a mezmerizing alt-country chanteuse with a hauntingly beautiful voice.\n\nDrawing comparisons to JJ Cale and Gordon Lightfoot, Tom Heyman has performed with a myriad of bands over the years and has three of his own albums of original music under his belt. He considers himself a folksinger whose job is to tell stories that draw the listener in to his world.",

Formed in 2011 by Ben Swardlick, Eric Luttrell, and Andy Coenen, the group has quickly risen to prominence on the strength of their wholly original and forward-thinking sound. \n\nTranscending genre, the group effortlessly bounds between hard-hitting dance tracks and thoughtful, indie-styled vocal songs, tying it all together with a distinctly cinematic presentation. The group achieved initial viral success with a teaser video for their two-part album Metropolis. The group's debut EP, Metropolis Pt. I, was released in April 2012 on Skrillex's OWSLA label. Inspired by Fritz Lang's seminal 1927 film Metropolis, the group created an entire mythology for the release, each song telling part of the story of the dystopian city of Metropolis. After an extensive run of official remixes for Bruno Mars, Passion Pit, Datsik/Kill The Noise, and Madeon, The M Machine returned to original production, elevating their craft to the rave reviews of their peers (read Skrillex, Porter Robinson, and Madeon). The second installment of their album, Metropolis Pt. II, released by OWSLA in February 2013, marked a new high water point in terms of the group's creativity and production. The Metropolis saga was completed with the release of Metropolis Remixed, a revamped retrospective of the previous two EPs that featured remixes from Kill The Noise, Digitalism, Robotaki, and more. Most recently the group remixed Dog Blood and Empire Of The Sun; both remixes were released to much fanfare. \n\nThe M Machine has performed at high-profile festivals including Electric Daisy Carnival (Las Vegas & NYC), Tomorrowland, Outside Lands, South by Southwest, Nocturnal Wonderland, Electric Forest, Electric Zoo, and Camp Bisco. Other highlights include a support slot for the entire \"Language Tour\" with Porter Robinson, and a support slot for Skrillex at Red Rocks in Denver. With support from many of the world's most notable DJs, including Tiesto, Skrillex, Porter Robinson, Madeon, Markus Schulz, Benny Benassi, Zane Lowe, and Pete Tong, The M Machine continue to carve themselves a distinct niche in the ever-changing landscape of electronic music.\n\nOpening set by talented producer/dj duo, ENSO\n\nFor VIP table packeges, email reservations@audiosf.com\n\n21+",

In celebration of the 10th anniversary of Proof Lab, we present a group of artists and an event shaped around a theme rooted as much in surfing and skateboarding as it is in dedication to change and evolution.  \n\nAs an artist and an entreprenuer, Ian Ross was encouraged and supported by the community and friends he made at the Proof Lab.  Their devotion to supporting local artists has earned them a lot of respect, as they put it, \"The founders and staff of Proof Lab are not artists of the caliber featured on these walls, but we have found comfort, joy and inspiration in their work. The lines they draw, the transitions they navigate as their craft develops, their ability to capture/express the essence of a feeling/idea/place/experience as real as a landscape or as mysterious as the subconscious, the way they surprise and make us imagine things differently, have all been gifts.\"   \n\nAlong with such great artists as Mike Shine, Russ Pope, Mark Gonzalez and Craig Stecyk (to name a few) there will be many others to enjoy, as well as new murals outside!  Please join us for this unique collaboration, \"Living In Transition\".\n\nFeatured Artists: ZIO ZIEGLER - MIKE SHINE - IAN ROSS - BIGFOOT - RUSS POPE - MARK GONZALES - STEVE CABALLERO - CRAIG STECYK - BEN HORTON - CANNON DILL - KYLEA BORGES - JAMES HAUNT - VOLCOM CREW - PATAGONIA CREW - ROARK CREW - REAL CREW - AND MORE",

        "description": "Wed Sept 24, 8pm\nTurquoise Yantra Grotto\n32 Turquoise Way SF\n$10 \n\nBirgit Ulher (trumpet, radios, speaker, objects) and Tim Perkis(computer, electronics) practice a brand of atmospheric improvisation sometimes referred to as \"minimal\"... But Birgit objects to this characterization of it:\n\n I understand that people discuss my music as a form of reductionism or minimalism, but for me it\u2019s also kind of strange because things happen all the time. It is a multiplicity of sounds. \n\n\nPerhaps the salient feature is that there is a sense of entering an environment which is held loosely, left to evolve at an organic pace -- or  perhaps a stepping-back from the busywork of 'self-expression' that is the focus of much jazz-inflected improv music. There is the sense that the players may be as interested and surprised by what emerges as anyone else in the room, and that they too are responding to it more than forcing it to be something in particular.  Insect sounds (not literally), the sounds of air and wind (not literally), the movement of water on rocks (not literally). \n\nBirgit Ulher\nBorn 1961 in Nuremberg, she studied the visual arts, which still have an important influence on her music. Since moving to Hamburg in 1982 she has been involved in free improvisation and experimental music. Since then she has \u201cestablished a distinguished grammar of sounds beyond the open trumpet\u201d (jazzdimensions.de). She performs solo, with dancers, working ensembles, and one-time collaborations with musicians from around the world. Current projects include duos with Ute Wassermann, Gino Robair, Christoph Schiller and Stereo Trumpet with Leonel Kaplan and the trio Nordzucker (with Chris Heenan and Michael Maierhof).Performances in Europe, the US, South America, Russia and the Middle East together with UNSK, the Trio PUT (with Ulrich Phillipp and Roger Turner), Nordzucker, Dorothea Sch\u00fcrch, Heddy Boubaker, Martin Klapper, Rhodri Davies, Chris Heenan, Tim Perkis, Robyn Schulkowsky, John Edwards, Damon Smith, Gene Coleman, Sean Meehan, Ernesto Rodrigues, Nate Wooley, Bryan Eubanks and Sven Ake Johansson.\nTim Perkis has been working in the medium of live electronic and computer sound for many years, performing, exhibiting installation works and recording in North America,Europe and Japan. His work has largely been concerned with exploring the emergence of life-like properties in complex systems of interaction.\n\nHe has taught at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and the California College of the Arts (CCA); has been composer-in-residence at Mills College in Oakland California, artist-in-residence at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, and designed musical tools and toys at Paul Allen's legendary thinktank, Interval Research. In 2013 he was a resident fellow at the Mediterranean Institute of Advanced Research (IM\u00e9RA) of the University of Aix-Marseille in France.\n\nHis checkered career as a researcher and engineer has brought him a variety of interesting projects: creating data sonification displays for research physicists and biologists in France; designing museum displays for science and music museums in San Francisco, Toronto and Seattle; creating artificial-intelligence based auction tools for business; working on mobile phone based support systems for the blind; consulting on multimedia art presentation networks for the SF Art Commission and SF Airport; writing software embedded in toys and other consumer products; and creating new tools for sound and video production, research and analysis. He is also producer and director of a feature-length documentary on musicians and sound artists in the San Francisco Bay area called NOISY PEOPLE (2007).\n\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nI like to consider human-machine interaction as a new form of social interaction. What's interesting to me about computers is their ability to serve as a framework for embodying systems offering complexity and surprise. Unpredictability is what makes social life so interesting, it is what makes art so interesting, and it's what can make computers, as partners in art making, interesting. I don't use computers to simply carry out ideas I may have: I'd rather work in situations that force me to respond to surprises that are dealt to me by systems whose complexity and unpredictability are so high that their behavior can not be known in advance. All of my computer based art work has been concerned with creating social (or synthetic social) situations, which have enough complexity to behave like real life: in fact, to be real life of some new kind. The system in question in almost all of these pieces consists of human beings and machines in cycles of mutual influence and response.\n\n*******************************************************\n\nThe Turquoise Yantra Grotto is a house concert series for avant improvisers and invented instrumentalists with a focus on ethno-modernism and extended techniques.

This is an important cause and it needs your support.  In return you will be part of a vital movement to end mass incarceration, free our political prisoners and gain experience for future endeavors.\n\nPLEASE WRITE JALIL AT:  \nAnthony Jalil Bottom #77A4283\nAttica Correctional Facility, P.O. Box 149, Attica NY 14011-0149\n \n                   \nABOUT:  \"Jalil Abdul Muntaqim (Anthony Bottom) and Albert Nub Washington were arrested in San Francisco during an armed confrontation with police. Their arrests came only one week after the assassination of .....\" http://www.freejalil.com/history.html\n\nOver forty years later and more than seven denials at the parole board, Jalil remains strong in hope and missive.\n \n SOME OF JALIL\u2019S ACCOMPLISHMENTS INCLUDE:\n\n     \u201cIn 1986, Mr. Bottom drafted a legislative bill for New York State prisoners to obtain good time off their sentence. The bill was submitted and introduced into the New York State Assembly \u2013 Committee on Corrections by former Assemblyman Arthur O. Eve.\n     In 1994, while incarcerated at Shawangunk Correctional Facility, Mr. Bottom established the first Men's Council in the United States prison. His efforts were featured on television in Japan and written about in the NY Times. During this period, he also graduated from SUNY New Paltz with a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Sociology.\nInstead of resting on his success, he taught African Studies to a group of prisoners.  On two occasions, he received commendations from prison officials for quelling potential prison riots, one in the mess hall at Great Meadow Correctional Facility and another time in the auditorium at Greenhaven, Correctional Facility.\n \n     From 1996 to 1999, Mr. Bottom was the office manager of the prison computer lab at Eastern Correctional Facility. His duties consisted of teaching prisoners keyboarding skills and how to use computer software programs. Despite his busy schedule, he found the time to raise money from inmate accounts to support the charitable Children's Funds.\n     In 1999, in Auburn Correctional Facility, Mr. Bottom established sociology, poetry, and legal research and discussion classes under the auspices of the Lifer's Committee that he chaired.\n      Mr. Bottom co-sponsored the Victory Gardens Project, a program in which farmers in Maine grew tons of fresh produce for distribution to poor urban communities in New York, New Jersey and Boston, Massachusetts. In the four years of its existence, the Project distributed nearly 10,000 pounds of fresh produce in urban centers.\n     \n     In response to the tragedy of September 11, 2001, while in Auburn Correctional Facility, Mr. Bottom proposed raising funds from inmates to donate to the American Red Cross. Former Deputy Superintendent of Programs R. Nelson acknowledged Anthony's efforts in a memorandum.\n     While in Auburn Correctional Facility he worked as a Pre-GED Teacher's Assistant and earned a vocational certificate for Architectural Drafting. Mr. Bottom has proposed and gained the approval for a Life Skills Program for inmates.\n      Mr. Bottom is a published poet and essayist; his writings are found in several University sponsored books of compilations of prison writers.  He has also written an unpublished novel and teleplay.\"  (from:  http://www.freejalil.com/parole01.html )\n \n \nLETTER FROM JALIL:\n \n\u201cFirst, I want to thank all of you who wrote letters and signed the petition in support of my release on parole. We did everything right!\nHowever, the problem is that the New York State parole system is overwhelmingly comprised of law enforcement advocates and sympathizers prejudicial to community growth and development. Obviously, if the community needs were supported by policy makers, crime would decrease, job security in the overall Prison Industrial Complex (PIC) would be threatened, and the profit-based prison system would be less profitable. Therefore any prisoner, who advocates, as I do, community control of the institutions, is deemed a threat to the PIC\u2019s; future, and we are continuously denied release on parole.\n \nWe presented an excellent parole plan, with over fifty support letters, 750 names on a signature petition, two independent psychological risk assessment reports favoring release on parole, the DOCCS own computer Risk Assessment analysis and report that indicated low risk to be a recidivist, two housing and work assurance letters, no prison disciplinary reports, every recognized certificate for rehabilitation programs, copies of High School diploma and two college degrees (BA in Sociology and BS in Psychology) and, just as importantly, two letters from the victim\u2019s & family expressing forgiveness and urging my release on parole.\n \nNonetheless, as you can see, the parole board issued a boilerplate denial in abject disregard of the factual record of community support for my release and return to the community, disrespecting the victim & family and their own risk assessment analysis and report.\n \nIt has become ever more apparent that the New York State Division of Parole is a political institution with a right-wing agenda, which Governor Andrew Cuomo supports. He recently failed to appoint a single Black person as a commissioner to the parole board, despite the fact that 48% of all New York State prisoners are Black.\n \nThe parole denial will be appealed, so the fight for freedom continues. We need a community review board of the parole system, community direct involvement in the decision-making process on who will be returned to the community.

Before touring the globe and amassing millions of hits online with his series of beloved tracks and mixes, the young man came up as a true disciple, absorbing hip hop and RnB culture since his childhood and finding ways to make the music his own.\n \nSince the age of fourteen, when he first began to DJ and the following year when his brother introduced him to music production software, his output has been relentless. As he explains, \u201cafter he showed me the basics, from that day on I couldn\u2019t stop making beats,\u201d pumping out a beat a day for the next couple of years and soon after self-releasing a series of EPs and beat tapes that quickly began to expand his reach. Official releases on HW&W and Jakarta Records soon spread his name like wildfire and some instant-classic remixes by the likes of Missy Elliot, Janet Jackson, TLC, Danny Brown and others have cemented his reputation and his sound; an undeniable swing of the drums comparable to Dilla\u2019s, a signature soulful touch in the melodies, and a healthy dose of funky bass lines.\n \nIn the past year, he was approached by Brodinski to drop the single \u201cFree Things In Life\u201d on the hotly-tipped French label Bromance, has headlined tours in Europe, Australia and North America, and released his newest single and video \u201cAt All\u201d which has already conquered dance floors worldwide and introduced his face to the world with an unforgettable video. Now, as he continues to bridge the gap between the dance world and hip hop/RnB, he is prepping a solo album for 2014 and a series of high profile collaborations that will confirm his position as one of the most important producers in today\u2019s musical landscape.",

Robert Zhao's practice investigates the relationship between man and nature through ficto-critical images and narratives. Zhao has developed much of his work as part of a fictitious research organization called the Institute of Critical Zoologists (http://www.criticalzoologists.org/). Since 2009, Zhao has also been affiliated with The Land Archive (TLA), an organization revealing mankind's impact on his natural environment from an artist's perspective, focusing on the history and changes of the landscape in Singapore.\n\nOver drinks, Zhao will talk about his previous work and his research plans during his residency here in San Francisco, CA. The production of new works during the residency will later culminate in an exhibition at Kadist, scheduled for November 19, 2014.\n\nZhao also will screen 'A Guide to the Flora and Fauna of the World,' a documentary directed by Jow Zhi Wei. \"Foregoing the framework of a conventional documentary, Jow immerses himself in Zhao\u2019s working process during of his field trips into a forested area in which he conducts a survey of a Banyan tree. The camera tracks Zhao\u2019s movements and assumes his gaze to illustrate how prolonged observation is required to facilitate the emergence of various perspectives into the environment and its inhabitants.\u201d (National Museum of Singapore Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que)\n\nThis event is presented in conjunction with the third edition of Asian Contemporary Art Week (September 20-28, 2014).

Her music goes wherever it damn-well needs to, making stops in lands of folk, electronic, satire, singer/songwriter, and rock.  Her shows are heartfelt, connected, and lyrical, and her varied style takes her to many different types of venues and events. She began her musical journey in March of 2013 with a toy piano, a microKorg XL, and a toy drumkit.  Insisting that looping was too complicated, she played all her instruments at the same time to create unique and surprisingly dancey compositions.  She recorded her debut EP, \"I Wouldn't Worry\" with Travis Perkins and Tim Ponton of Ex'pression College, and featured collaborations with local beatboxing legend, Infinite, and sitar/songstress, Gabby La La. In February 2014 she began a monthly series at Boom Boom Room called \"The Larkade,\" which features local live and electronic artists, and Rachel Lark besties and local DJ's, JK-47.  She is a regular featured artist at Bawdy Storytelling, where she has been writing custom ukulele songs for their shows since May 2013.  She recently recorded an album called \"Lark After Dark,\" which she recorded at The Center SF in front of a live crowd using only her ukulele as accompaniment.\n\nSIGNUPS will also be that night for anyone else.\nThe list fills up quickly, so if you want to perform, you'd better get there early... \n\nIf you're going to perform, keep it under 5 MINUTES. That's right: 5 MINUTES. WE WILL TIME YOU. And we will hug you when we have to stop you [just to make it easier on you (or harder - depending on your propensity for intimacy)].\n\nPoetry, prose, music, dancing, comedy, drama, happy, sad, & on & on & on... Remember: EVERYTHING GOES... so do whatever you want.\n\nYou don't have to perform anything. You are just as welcome to sit back, relax, clap at what you love and hiss at what you hate.\n\nPlease don\u2019t perform anything with a setup that takes much more time than the time it takes for you to walk onstage. Honestly, plugging things in endlessly is boring. If you need to borrow an instrument, figure it out before you're called to the stage.\n\nIMPORTANT ::: DON'T TAKE YOURSELF SO SERIOUSLY. Come and have fun. The end. Remember. Someday, we won't exist and neither will the English language. If you choose to take yourself seriously, then take yourself so seriously that it's stupid. Ridiculousness is encouraged.\n\nYou're Going to Die... no. really. you are.",

On the weekends she photographed with her large format camera at the nearby construction site for what is now the Moscone Convention Center. After witnessing the nighttime demolition of an adjacent residential hotel, Delaney became interested in the rippling economic effects urban renewal was having on poor and working class residents. Leaving the construction site behind, Delaney joined local efforts to protest the city\u2019s treatment of the community and began to photograph and interview her neighbors in their homes and places of work.\n\nSouth of Market is not a romantic representation of San Francisco\u2019s past, but rather a testament to a vanished community made up of blue-collar workers, small business owners, families with children, artists, and gay men. The work is especially relevant today, as a new wave of gentrification brought on by the second internet boom is again driving less affluent residents out of San Francisco. \u201cAs I continue to photograph in San Francisco and in urban areas around the world,\u201d says Delaney, \u201cI see that who plays and who pays remains, as it always was, the central issue.\u201d\n\nA book sale and signing will follow the talk.\n\n\nEvent link: http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=1017047501",

Using a 1924 seven-ton construction steamroller and an unlikely letterpress bed - the surface of Rhode Island Street itself - a team of 6 featured artists and printers create large-scale prints from three-foot-square hand-carved \"Battleship linoleum\" blocks. Now in its 11th year, Roadworks has become a popular tradition in the Potrero Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, drawing printmaking and book art enthusiasts from far and wide, as well as families with kids of all ages.\n\nNew this year at Roadworks is the Speedball Creativity Zone featuring FREE hands-on block printing fun for everyone and Roadworks Community Linocut Prints created by 8 community members, which will be sold at the event to benefit San Francisco Center for the Book.\n\nAs a bonus, Water Paper Stone: A Walk-Thru Book authored by Judy O'Shea will be on exhibit during the event at San Francisco Center for the Book. Water Paper Stone celebrates the experiences Judy writes about in her memoir Water Paper Stone. Art from 18 of the French and American artists who participated in the artist-in-residence Judy and her husband hosted in Plaisance, France will be featured in this installation.\n\nThe large-scale steamroller prints created at the 2014 Roadworks Steamroller Printing Festival will be for sale during the event. The steamroller prints are highly limited editions. If you are interested in the work of a specific featured artist, contact us to reserve your print in advance.",

But it was precisely the arms transfers and funding of ISIS by the U.S.'s principal allies in the region, especially Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, that has allowed the Islamic state to grow strong in its struggle to topple the secular Syrian government led by Bashar Al-Assad. \n\nLet's tell the fundamental truth that the Obama Administration conceals from the people. The so-called Islamic State or ISIS wouldn't exist today as a major force either in Syria or Iraq except for the U.S. military aggression that smashed the secular, nationalist governments in Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011 followed by its catastrophic support for the armed opposition against the similarly organized government in Syria.\n\nThe U.S. bombing of Syria territory is taking place without the consent of the Syrian government. It is one more U.S. violation of international law and Syrian sovereignty. The Syrian government had offered to cooperate with the United States in a joint military struggle against the reactionary forces of ISIS. That offer has, however, been immediately and categorically rejected by all in the U.S. ruling class political circles who has already announced that the Syrian government must be destroyed. Obama and the Pentagon and the CIA and, last and least,  the bribed and corrupted talking heads in Congress are determined to use the attack against the Islamic State as a pretext to carry out regime change in Syria by military means even though the the Syrian government has been the most effective military force in struggling against the so-called Islamic State.\n\nThe real objectives of US imperialism are to locate permanent Pentagon military bases in Iraq, Syria and the entire resource rich region of the Middle East. This is goal: the projection of permanent imperial power and domination in a region that contains two thirds of the worlds oil reserves.\n\nFor the past twenty four years the US has relentlessly bombed Iraq and now it is bombing Syria. Neither Iraq or Syria have ever attacked the United States or its people. This enduring war against previously colonized peoples is justified with shifting and changing rationales. But it is illegal. It is an expression of modern day imperialism. It is causing chaos and destruction in the targeted countries. And ultimately it will  fail to satisfy its objectives because it is based on the fantasies of those who have become drunk on that now familiar toxic combination of unbridled arrogance and military power.\n\nThe majority of people of the United States oppose this endless war in Iraq and now Syria. It is not in their interest.  At any moment this or that poll will announce that the American people favor military action of some sort. This is paper thin propaganda. If the country and its people were actually  threatened the Commander in Chief would not have to go on national TV and promise the people  that this war will involve \u201cno boots on the ground.\u201d There is no clearer indication that the motivation for the new imperial war is not just flimsy but false.",

        "description": "blasthaus presents\nHYPERDUB 10 Year Anniversary Tour w/\nKode9\nDJ Spinn b2b Taso\nScratcha DVA\n\nFor Hyperdub\u2019s first four years, the label moved carefully when it came to releases. Most of their output from 2004\u20132006 was credited to Goodman and Spaceape, including the duo\u2019s debut LP Memories of the Future, but they also worked with some guy named William Bevan, whose self-titled debut LP as Burial came in 2006, a year after Goodman put out the project\u2019s wobbly first 12\u201c, South London Boroughs. Burial was a modest record that initially attracted curiosity more than it did accolades, but in 2007 Bevan returned with the excellent Ghost Hardware 12\u201d and the instant classic Untrue, a record that came to define dubstep for legions of new listeners seven years before Merriam Webster decided to define it themselves.\nOne of the most influential electronic records  in recent memory, Untrue cemented Bevan as one of the decade\u2019s most vital producers and introduced dubstep (more as a concept, less as a sound) to a much wider audience. So you can imagine what its success did for Hyperdub. A brief glance at the label\u2019s chronological catalog resembles a dam about to burst, and Untruewas the low frequency that shook the firmament to the point of collapse. In 2008 came releases from up-and-coming names that, six years later, are familiar to anyone in the know: bass music basket case Zomby, abstracted pop outfit Darkstar (who at that point were working with a more explicitly dance-focused sound), dubstep-gone-freestyle queen Ikonika. Martin\u2019s lover\u2019s rock-focused King Midas Sound project even put out their first release for the label that year.\nHyperdub marked their fifth anniversary in 2009, but despite a half-decade of existence, the label\u2019s creative surge had kicked into high gear only two years previous. So the excellent 5 Years of Hyperdub was as much an overview of where Hyperdub had been as it was a chance to draw on the increased exposure electronic music was receiving and define something approaching a \u201cscene.\u201d Ace cuts from Los Angeles hip-hop auteur Flying Lotus, Dutch dance producer Martyn, and dub-as-fuck mad scientist Mala appeared alongside catalog highlights from label regulars Kode9, LV, and yes, Burial.\n5 Years of Hyperdub was the culmination of a series of five 12\" releases collecting label highlights\u20145.1, 5.2, you get the idea\u2014and the expanded approach Hyperdub\u2019s taken to that concept for their 10-year anniversary is indicative of how quickly Goodman\u2019s label has grown, both in size and influence. 10.1 is a two-CD set\u2014the first in the series, no less\u2014with one disc collecting tracks from the label\u2019s last five years and one with entirely new material. Each compilation will have a theme, and 10.1 turns its focus towards dancefloor-centered cuts, so those waiting for a collection of Hyperdub\u2019s stranger entries might have to wait a little longer.\nThat said, 10.1 is more proof that Hyperdub can\u2019t help but embrace left-of-center even as it focuses on club fare. This is far from a bad thing: Hyperdub\u2019s released some of the most appealingly odd and oddly prescient electronic music of the last 15 years, and the glaring omissions from this volume\u2019s disc of catalog cuts\u2014Terror Danjah\u2019s fiery grime tune \u201cAcid\u201d from 2010, Ossie\u2019s bubbly UK Funky cut \u201cSet the Tone\u201d from 2011, the jagged piano-house of Laurel Halo\u2019s \u201cThrow\u201d, from last year's Behind the Green Door EP\u2014only serve to highlight the wealth of material the label has released.\nDance music label comps serve a dual purpose: 1) provide an accessible way for non-collectors to obtain material that might\u2019ve received limited release; 2) offer labels a way to define their legacy or current position in the music landscape. 10.1 fulfills the first function simply by existing, and effectively flips two middle fingers towards the second. One of the most intriguing elements of Hyperdub\u2019s output is its sheer unpredictability and refusal of easy categorization. The closest thing to dubstep proper on the first disc is Burial and Spaceape\u2019sBurial cut \u201cSpaceape\u201d, an obvious nod to Hyperdub\u2019s humble beginnings; from there, we\u2019re hit with variations on the breezy skip of Funky (Funkystepz\u2019s \u201cHurricane Riddim\u201d, Ill Blu\u2019s \u201cClapper\u201d), 8-bit fantasias (Ikonika\u2019s \u201cIdiot\u201d, Walton\u2019s \u201cAggy\u201d), low-slung hip-hop (Mark Pritchard and Om\u2019mas Keith\u2019s \u201cWind It Up\u201d), and effervescent grime (Kode9\u2019s \u201cXingfu Lu\u201d).\nIn addition to shining a light on the difficulty of categorizing Hyperdub, the old-stuff collection is further proof that the label\u2019s vision is always trained forward. Appearances from regulars Ikonika and Cooly G are a reminder that, along with Laurel Halo and Canadian techno-pop architect Jessy Lanza, Hyperdub\u2019s been one of the few of-the-moment dance labels to consistently showcase female artists. Stylistically, they\u2019ve also found themselves ahead of the curve: Morgan Zarate\u2019s as-of-yet-underappreciated \u201cHookid\u201d, from 2011, is a tangled sigh of staircase tones, phased-out bass hits, and cascading synths ripped from Southern U.S. hip-hop. At the time, it was a curiosity; in 2014, it sounds like a trap precedent, if that sound\u2019s basic elements were scrambled in a blender and poured all over some poor sap\u2019s kitchen counter.\nThe new-stuff disc offers few hints as to where the label is headed next, which is unsurprising, but the variety on display is only matched by the quality of the tunes themselves. Detroit techno fiend Kyle Hall\u2019s \u201cGirl U So Strong\u201d builds and breaks with wheezing tones and backbeats, a throaty diva shout occasionally popping up to offer an anchor; Zarate returns with the hard-hitting \u201cKaytsu\u201d, a track even more explicitly trap than the genre-predicting \u201cHookid\u201d, while the relatively quiet producer Kuedo (whose 2011 LP Severant still stands as an overlooked gem) returns with a track dubbed after his namesake and sporting his signature Vangelis-meets-Big Tymers style of aural hypnotism. Following the explicit reggae of his Essential Mix from last year, Mala delivers one of his meanest anthems to date with the stomping \u201cExpected\u201d, while Japanese producer and Hyperdub mainstay Quarta330 closes out the disc with the hyper-colorful \u201cHanabi\u201d.\nThe \u201cwhat\u2019s to come\u201d section takes up the back half of 10.1\u2019s fresh-jams collection, in the form of a stretch of footwork primarily from the Teklife crew. Footwork continues to gain a greater presence in the electronic world, aided by fellow UK label Planet Mu\u2019s scene-surveying Bangs & Works compilations and cemented by last year\u2019s classic LP from the late DJ Rashad, Double Cup. Earlier this year, Goodman told The Japan Times that he was drawn to getting involved with the genre by way of Planet Mu founder Mike Paradinas: \u201cMike said to me, \u2018Go on, release this stuff, because everyone thinks I\u2019m crazy.\u2019\u201d\nParadinas had a point\u2014footwork in its rawest form can be grating, and the stretch of brown-sound bass hits and repetitive vocal samples that mark the back half of the first disc of 10.1may lead to a few headaches. But Hyperdub\u2019s embrace of the genre was perfectly timed, and the cuts presented here showcase a scene that is further mutating and innovating as it gains more widespread attention. Taso & Djunya\u2019s \u201cOnly the Strong Survive\u201d pairs footwork\u2019s intense focus with a starry-eyed sense of wonder, DJ Spinn\u201c\u2019s \u201dAll My Teklife\u201c features synths that glisten so bright they threaten to overpower everything else around them, and DJ Earl\u2019s \u201dI\u2019m Gonna Get You\" hammers its titular phrase home to the point of aggravation until the sample drops out with a sense of relief before revving up all over again.\nRashad appears posthumously on both discs of 10.1: along with DJ Taye, he had a hand in DJ Earl\u2019s other cut on the new disc, the typically intense \u201cBombaklot\u201d, and Rashad and Gant-Man further explore Double Cup\u2019s acid techno flirtations on the enjoyable \u201cAcid Life\u201d. He also closes out the disc of catalog highlights\u2014the comp was announced well before Rashad\u2019s sudden and tragic death last month, so this is an unusual occurrence of timing above all else\u2014with the epochal \u201cLet It Go\u201d. A titanic track that could be considered footwork\u2019s own \u201cStrings of Life\u201d, \u201cLet It Go\u201d has a classic, immovable sound, as a lone drum machine kicks things off before meeting up with the endlessly, blissfully repeated vocal sample. Some warped strings enter, and for a second it seems like things are off\u2014\u201cSomething doesn\u2019t sound right\u201d is, granted, an understandable reaction to most footwork\u2014but then the vocal sample completes itself with a diva\u2019s cry, \u201cBaaa-by/ Bayyyyyy-beeeeee\u201d, that hits like a gut-punch.\n\u201cLet It Go\u201d was released on March 18, 2013, as part of Rashad\u2019s excellent Rollin\u2019 EP for Hyperdub; a year, one month, and eight days later, he was found dead at his home in Chicago\u2019s West Side. Before his death, I must have personally listened to \u201cLet It Go\u201d at least eight or nine times a week, and every time I put it on, it took me places that only the most impressionistically beautiful pieces of music can go. I\u2019ve listened to it while feeling sad, happy, unsure, frustrated, in love, out of place\u2014basically, it\u2019s music I put on when I want to feelsomething. After Rashad\u2019s death, the urge to latch onto the track\u2019s more melancholy aspects is there, but every time I reach for \u201cLet It Go\u201d, the flood of emotions remains rich and complex. Rashad touched a lot of people with his visionary, melodic approach to footwork, and the dance community has only begun feeling the effects of his legacy; amidst the incredible collection of tunes on 10.1, \u201cLet It Go\u201d is proof that, even in the ever-changing world of electronic music, it\u2019s possible to create something that sounds absolutely timeless.         -Pitchfork Media",

        "description": "Sonata Arctica was born in 1996 on the edge of the world, in the northern Finnish town of Kemi. The very first incarnation of the band was named Tricky Beans. As Tricky Beans, the group produced three demos (Friend till the End, Agre Pamppers and PeaceMaker) and played twice in Jyrki S\u00e4hk\u00f6sirkus, a live tour version of a then famous TV pop show.After some personnel changes in 1997, the outfit changed their name to Tricky Means. Let it be known to the Metal community that initially the band experimented in musical styles far from heavy metal.Turning the page in 1999, Tricky Means recorded a new demo \"FullMoon\" in Tico Tico Studios located in their hometown, Kemi. At the time of recording the line-up consisted of: Tony (vocals/keys), Jani (guitars), Tommy (drums), and Janne (bass). This new demo was the first exploration for the band in heavy metal waters. The band's trademark sound of fast, melodic and keyboard oriented heavy metal with clear and high vocals was born. As fate would have it, and with help from Ahti Kortelainen of Tico Tico Studios, the \"FullMoon\" demo found its way to the premier metal label of Finland, Spinefarm. At the same time Tricky Means became Sonata Arctica. Summer of 1999 brought us the first single from Sonata Arctica, \"UnOpened\". The title song was instantaneously included in Metalliliitto 1999 compilation CD. Two furious tracks from the single, UnOpened and Mary-Lou marked the arrival of SA to the power metal community. Of course, not everything went smoothly. During the first mix/pressing of the UnOpened single, Track 1, UnOpened, was unintentionally slowed down. The mistake was discovered shortly after the first batch of disks was sent to music stores. The entire first pressing was recalled. Approximately 200 copies from that first run were sold and are now considered rare collector's items. Autumn of 1999 marked the release of the very first full-length album, \"Ecliptica\". Initially released in Finland, other countries quickly followed. Widely successful, Ecliptica opened doors for Sonata Arctica to participate in two tribute records. 'I Want Out' for a Helloween tribute album \"Keepers of Jericho\" and 'Still Loving You' for a Scorpions tribute, \"A Tribute to the Scorpions\" were both kick-ass versions of originals. Soon after the release of Ecliptica, the band's mastermind Tony Kakko decided to concentrate more on singing, as opposed to trying to sing and play keyboards at the same time. Mikko H\u00e4rkin (ex-Kenziner) joined the band to relief Tony from keys and to allow the frontman to roam the stage. This change allowed for much more energetic live shows. It introduced a new capability for Sonata Arctica - to have two keyboard players simultaneously, adding a new cool twist to the live sound. Quick rise to fame continued through the end of 1999 and beginning of 2000. Soon after the release of Ecliptica, Sonata Arctica was chosen as support band for Stratovarius' European Tour, winning over 32 other bands from 15 different record companies. The tour started in April of 2000 with Strato and Rhapsody on the road. It lasted for two months, during which Sonata played over 30 gigs in 10 countries, traveling thousands of kilometers. Very successful tour was followed by the release of the new mini-CD Successor. This new disk included two previously unreleased tracks, two cover tracks for upcoming tribute albums, some live tracks from Provinssi Rock and one edited track from Ecliptica. In a small line-up change, Janne Kivilahti made a decision to part with the band due to personal reasons. Janne's last gig took place in Kemi on 30th June in the summer of 2000. Janne was replaced by Marko Paasikoski, who happened to be one of the founding members of Tricky Beans. Being a familiar face to the entire band, the transition was smooth and transparent. Year 2000 brought not only a big tour, new mini-CD, and a small line-up change, but also media recognition. Sonata was chosen as a candidate for \"the best new-comer band\" by the Finnish Recording Industry Association in their annual Awards Gala, Emma. The new millennium is also treating the Sonata beans well. In the spring of 2001 Sonata Arctica opened two gigs For Alice Cooper, Dio and Ratt (in Oulu and Helsinki) in Monsters of the Millennium 2001 tour. Forging the metal while it is hot, the band worked on the second full-length offering from autumn of 2000 through the winter of 2001. Again all the songs were composed by the band's mastermind Tony Kakko. The first single, \"Wolf & Raven\" from the album, was released in May '01. The album was scheduled for an initial release in Japan in June, other territories following shortly after. This \"right of way\" for Japanese fans comes for a reason. The first album, Ecliptica, sold more than 30,000 copies in Japan within the first year of release. The band also played its first four concerts in Japan in September 2001. The latter half of 2001 was very busy for the band. In July a Finnish tour kicked off along with separate gigs (including Wacken Open Air in Germany) in Europe. Then the band headed towards the Land of The Rising Sun in September. After the Japanese tour Sonata Arctica toured the Europe as a support act for the heavy metal monsters Gamma Ray along with Vanishing Point as special guests. During the 5 weeks on the road, the band conquered a total of 12 countries with 28 shows. The tour ended with a show in Helsinki, Finland to the delight of the Finnish fans in November. While touring, the second single from the album Silence, \"Last Drop Falls\", was released. The song got aired quite well in the domestic radio stations, gathering even more popularity for the band. Three weeks after the European tour, it was time for the second leg of the Finnish tour. Thirteen well-received gigs were played across Finland. The Finnish shows at the end of 2001 and in the beginning of 2002 were just an appetizer for the following tour in South America. Four shows in Brazil and two more in Chile truly showed the huge popularity of the band - the crowds they met were amongst the best and wildest ever. During one of the shows the band couldn't even hear its own playing since the crowd was louder than the huge loudspeakers! The next release was the live album \"Songs Of Silence\". It was recorded in Tokyo, September 4th, 2001. The European and Asian editions had completely different artworks, both made by Janne \"ToxicAngel\" Pitk\u00e4nen who also became the exclusive artist for the following Sonata Arctica releases. The Asian version was released in March while the other parts of the world got their live album in July/August. After the last show of the Silence tour, J\u00f6risrock 2002, Mikko H\u00e4rkin decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The band announced their search for the new keyboard player and got a huge amount of applications from all around the world. Two of the candidates, both well-known and highly skillful keyboardists from Finland, were asked to travel to Kemi for the audition. Since the capabilities of the players were already known among the band, the choose of the new member was a bit extraordinary - the band wanted a player who could fit not only musically but also mentally to the band, so they dragged the applicants one-by-one to the bar. After spending a night in a bar with the candidates, the band voted for Henrik Klingenberg. Henrik had been playing in various metal bands like Silent Voices and Requiem about a decade or so and he proved to be the right man for the job. The third studio album entitled \"Winterheart's Guild\" was recorded in the meantime, without the new keyboard player. A fellow mate of the band, Jens Johansson of Stratovarius, offered his helping hand and the band naturally was really pleased to get a world class keyboard player as a guest for their new album. Jens played solos for four songs while Tony handled most of the keyboard duties. Henrik's first appearance with Sonata Arctica was held on February 21st, 2003 in Tornio. Hundreds of people in the audience coming from all-over Finland greeted the band and the new keyboard player enthusiastically. With Henrik in the band they got a huge amount of extra energy and visual appearance. No more glued-to-the-stage keyboards, Klingenberg took the stage with a true rock attitude and joined the show actively with his portable keyboard. The second show ever with the new line-up was humbly held at the Tavastia club - the most legendary rock club in Finland! In Japan, Winterheart's Guild was released soon afterwards. The band hit the road and traveled to the Land of the Rising Sun, playing eight sold-out gigs. According to the audience on the shows, the band was truly on fire making their best live performances ever. The first single of Winterheart's Guild was \"Victoria's Secret\", a traditional Sonata Arctica tune with its melodic and speedy approach. During the first week the single notched #2 position on the official Finnish charts. The first position was taken over by Darude's new single which was released at the same time. During the next two weeks, Victoria's Secret seized the first position, leaving such names as Eminem, Negative and The Rasmus behind. Though the previous single \"Last Drop Falls\" was a hit in Finland, it never rose higher than #3 on the charts during its four months on them - Victoria's Secret truly became the most successful Sonata Arctica single until then. The domestic success continued after Winterheart's Guild was released in Finland. During its debutant week it peaked at #3, this time leaving The Rasmus, Eminem, T.A.T.U and Stratovarius behind. The album stayed five weeks on the top 10. After a successful album release it was naturally the right time for the first leg of the Finnish tour. Eight successive shows in Finland were followed by four more in France. The festival season was opened with Sweden Rock Festival (along with artists like Queensr\u00ffche, Yes, Kamelot, Whitesnake etc.), continued with e.g. Nummirock and the huge Sziget Festival in Hungary and ended with the legendary Wacken Open Air. The summer ended with the second leg of the Finnish tour. During this time 14,000 Finnish people had bought their copy of Winterheart's Guild. Two more releases were made during the latter half of 2003. The Finnish people enjoyed a new single, \"Broken\", which included two previously unreleased bonus tracks. The tracks were recorded over a year earlier though, with Mikko still in the band. Japanese fans got themselves an extra tribute in November - an EP called \"Takatalvi\". The EP was mostly a re-release of the already sold-out Successor EP with some additional material and without the live tracks. Because the previous recording deal with Spinefarm Records had completed with Winterheart's Guild, the band was marketing for a new deal. Needless to say, all of the major metal-releasing record companies were begging Sonata Arctica to join their ranks. After negotiations Sonata Arctica were signed to Nuclear Blast. In the beginning of 2004 Sonata Arctica was chosen as a warm-up band for the Japanese tourdates of Iron Maiden. After the Japanese gigs in February, the band came back to Finland just to find out they were one of the nominees for the annual Emma Award in the category \"the best hard rock / metal album\". The other nominees were Children Of Bodom, HIM and Kotiteollisuus who also won the award. March 2004 revealed two happy newsbits for Sonata Arctica. First of all, Tommy became a proud father of a newborn baby girl. The band also entered Tico Tico Studios in Kemi for the recording of their fourth studio album. This time the recording session featured also Henrik who added fresh spices to the soup, later on called \"Reckoning Night\". After over three months of hard work, the recordings were finally completed. The album was mixed and mastered in the famous Finnvox Studios. The release dates were fixed to the beginning of October.During the summer 2004 the band played on many festivals, this time conquering also new grounds. Finland's most famous metal festival, Tuska Open Air, got its part of Sonata frenzy in July. German fans got an additional bit of fame since Sonata Arctica played their first single from the forthcoming album, \"Don't Say A Word\", for the first time ever at the Summer Breeze festival. And finally, United Kingdom got also Sonatized when the band debuted at the famous Bloodstock Festival. Don't Say A Word (single) was released on August 23rd solely in Finland. Immediately after the release the single hit the first position on the official charts! The next week the single attached the second position, following only Children Of Bodom's new single. A week after that, the EP version of Don't Say A Word peaked at the fourth position and dropped the single to the fifth position - so, during one week, Sonata Arctica made history and had two releases on the top five in the official charts! The single version kept its second place during the next weeks, being totally six weeks in the top ten with the lowest position of 6th. The EP was also released in Japan on September 22nd. Slightly after the EP, the Japanese people got once again the pole position for getting the new Sonata Arctica album week prior the European release. In Finland the album peaked at second position for the first two weeks with only Rammstein selling more copies. Finland wasn't the only country where Reckoning Night entered the charts. In Germany the position was 77th, in Switzerland 85th and in Norway 69th. A headline tour was supposed to follow the release of Reckoning Night, but the band got an once-in-a-lifetime invitation from Nightwish to join their European tour as a special guest. The band opted in - Sonata Arctica toured Europe with Nightwish in arenas with capacities up to 12 000 people! During the tour band also played a handful of headliner shows over Europe. In October 2004, the band received extraordinary news: they'd exceeded the Gold record sales mark with Silence. Silence had become eventually the most sold album of the band reaching the magical limit of 15,000 copies! Despite some releases being really close reaching the gold disc plateau, Silence was the first release in the history of Sonata Arctica reaching the gold disc status. In November the sold-out audience of Helsinki, Tavastia club - the most famous rock club in Finland - witnessed Sonata Arctica receiving the long-awaited gold discs and thanked the band by applausing with probably the longest applauses in the history of the club. The gold disc party that started the whole Finnish tour was just the beginning - the following eighteen shows all around Finland exceeded all the earlier domestic tours by the number of shows and by the amount of audience. The final gig of the tour was at the newly-formed Finnish Metal Expo at Kaapelitehdas, Helsinki. From the beginning of the day the once again sold-out audience was eagerly awaiting Sonata Arctica to play, though the band was booked as the headliner and the last act of the whole-weekend expo! After midnight the audience finally received what it was been waiting for the whole weekend, and the entire hall virtually exploded. The ending show of the Finnish tour was not only performed in front of the sold-out huge audience of the metal expo, but also a good practice for the band for the forthcoming Japanese tour. Sonata Arctica played for the first time ever the same set the Japanese fans were going to receive during the exclusive Japanese tour - and what eventually became inevitable, the same set which would be later on released as their first DVD \"For The Sake Of Revenge\", recorded in Tokyo on February 4th and 5th, 2005. After the highly successful Japanese tour Sonata Arctica made a one-off Finnish gig at the 19th annual Emma (the Finnish Grammy) awards gala of the Finnish Recording Industry Association. If a metal band playing in a pop awards concert is a rarity, another rarity was Sonata Arctica performing only one song during the whole night: their first single from Reckoning Night, Don't Say A Word. The next big thing was going to be a long tour supporting their highly successful countrymen Nightwish, once again, during their first major North American tour, but the headliners were suddenly forced to cancel the tour. Despite this Sonata was invited to play a short tour of nine shows on the east coast. The band gave everything they got for the North American audience and promised to come back as soon as possible encouraged by the heart warming welcome they received both in USA and Canada. After the North American trip Sonata Arctica played a dozen of well-received festival appearances in Europe. The size of the venues was everything between the small Hullun Mylly at their hometown Kemi to the gigantic Sweden Rock Festival and the legendary Wacken Open Air. The festival season ended in August, and on August 24th the Japanese label Marquee/Avalon released the compilation album \"The End Of This Chapter\". The compilation included one previously unreleased version, an instrumental edition of \"Draw Me\" from the \"Winterheart's Guild\" album. The first limited edition of the compilation was equipped with a DVD including seven acoustic songs. The compilation is still TBA for the European and American release. Sonata Arctica didn't rest in silence, since just a small fraction of time after the release of the compilation album they were ready for the next leg of their European tour traveling all the way from the Netherlands to Italy and back. The following Finnish tour started modestly in October 21st at the Hartwall Arena, Helsinki - the biggest indoor venue in the whole country! Sonata Arctica opened for Nightwish who recorded their forthcoming actual DVD release and also dismissed their lead singer Tarja Turunen during the same night. The domestic tour advanced about a month after the forever-unforgettable night. This time the band and the management decided to go for the capacity and the quality instead of the quantity - the result leading for only eight concerts, arranged in the biggest rock clubs and venues in Finland. The gambling was successful: the venues were packed up with people from the very beginning to the final second of the tour, and the lucky ones getting their tickets early enough swore to have witnessed definitely the best shows of Sonata Arctica, ever. The latter half of December 2005 proved once again the magic of Sonata Arctica: their third album \"Winterheart's Guild\" was confirmed to receive the awaited gold disc status in Finland, selling over 15,000 copies, slightly before the year turning to 2006. Conquering Finland once and for all and reaching two once-in-a-lifetime goals during one month was not enough for the band, but they also fulfilled their earlier promise to play in the North America again - and this time it was not only few shows here and there, this time it was for real. The tour included 29 shows at 28 different venues, and it wasn't only a showcase for the whole American continent, but also a promise filled for their loyal fans left behind from the previous crippled tour in 2005. Shortly after \"Winterheart's Guild\" also the 4th studio album \"Reckoning Night\" was certified with gold disc status in Finland while the band was still touring in the North America in February 2006. The album was also confirmed to have 100,000 sold copies worldwide - thus being the most successful Sonata Arctica album ever. After finishing the North American tour in February Sonata Arctica soon continued by touring in Europe to promote their forthcoming live DVD \"For The Sake Of Revenge\". The band hit the road again in April with their fellow countrymen Altaria - with whom Jani used to play earlier! - and with the German-based hard rock legend Doro. After the tour finished, Sonata Arctica opted in for only six summer festival appearances, all of them in Finland. The worldwide Reckoning Night tour lasted in the end two years and it was brilliantly finished with an exclusive appearance in self-arranged and self-titled Sonata Arctica Open Air festival in Kemi, the hometown of the band. After their last live appearance in 2006 the band retreated from publicity and began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. The band also received yet another gold disc award, this time from their first-ever live DVD \"For The Sake Of Revenge\". The DVD not only achieved gold disc status, but it also ended up in the top 10 of the best-selling DVDs in Finland that year - all this, when the album had been for sale mere a few months! While the band was working hard in different studios recording their fifth studio album \"Unia\" - Finnish for \"Dreams\" -, Finnish press announced an official Sonata Arctica documentary being in production. The documentary film will follow Sonata Arctica in their hometown Kemi and also show how a Sonata Arctica song is being formed from the scratch to the very end of the creative process. The documentary will have its first public appearance during the annual music video festival of Oulu in September 2007. Meanwhile the documentary isn't the only non-musical work related to Sonata Arctica, since an official Sonata Arctica 3d role playing game for PC, called \"Winterheart's Guild\", is in the works. The fifth studio album of Sonata Arctica is called \"Unia\". The album was released in May 2007. Before the release of the album a single entitled \"Paid In Full\" was released in Finland, Germany and Japan. The single featured also a cover version of \"Out In The Fields\", a legendary song originally performed by Gary Moore and Phil Lynott. The single hit the #1 position in the official Finnish charts, sticked to second place the following week and stayed in the national top ten until \"Unia\" was released a month later. During the same week the new single was released the band played four gigs in the biggest rock clubs of Finland. The sizes of the venues varied from 700 to 2,300 people, and each night was sold out. The fans witnessed not one but three never-seen-before events during one show: Not only the songs from \"Unia\" were performed live for the very first time, but also Sonata Arctica appeared on stage first time ever without its founding member Jani Liimatainen and thus it was also the first time ever the band performed with a temporary replacement guest musician. Each and every show during the over decade-lasting career had been performed with the permanent line-up - until now. The guitarist Jani Liimatainen had to skip the four Finnish shows because of his civil duties for the Finnish government. Because of the length of the Finnish national duties, he is also forced to let the temping guitarist Elias Viljanen replace him temporarily during the summer festivals, the four Japanese shows and the North American tour. Sonata Arctica is confirmed to perform on a few selected festivals during the summer. In July the band travels to the Land of the rising Sun and the Japanese audience will be the first foreigners to hear the new songs from the \"Unia\" album performed live. After the festival season Sonata Arctica is ready for a four-show excursion to Mexico. These are the first Mexican shows ever! From Mexico the band continues to USA and Canada. Europe has been left quite a while without the magic of Sonata Arctica. However, in the end of October this will change when Sonata Arctica begins its massive headlining tour starting from Stockholm, Sweden. During the European tour the band plays in thirteen different countries with their support acts, the Netherlands-based Epica. With four gold disc awards and multiple sold-out tours Sonata Arctica has got its hands tightly attached to the history of Finnish metal music - and more will definately be achieved in the future!",

        "description": "The Hydra, a mythological serpent creature from ancientGreece, couldn\u2019t be killed. When one of its many heads was cut off, two more grew in its place...\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like us \u2013 undefeatable!\u201d laughs WITHIN TEMPTATION guitarist and songwriter Robert Westerholt. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, \u2018Hydra\u2019 is a perfect title for our new album, because like the monster itself, the record represents the many different sides of our music. This album\u2019s a total reawakening for us \u2013 a reinvention. It has some amazing and totally unexpected collaborations. We\u2019ve created a whole new sound and we can\u2019t wait for WITHIN TEMPTATION fans to hear it!\u201d\n\n\nHydra, the band\u2019s sixth studio album, offers a stellar cast of guests: Finnish operatic metal diva Tarja Turunen, acclaimed singer-songwriter Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum, metalcore hero Howard Jones (ex-Killswitch Engage, Devil You Know) andU.S.hip-hop icon, actor, and former MTV Pimp My Ride host Xzibit (Alvin Nathaniel Joiner).\n\n\nFollowing up on 2011\u2019s Billboard Top 200 album The Unforgiving was no easy task for the Dutch symphonic rock sextet. WITHIN TEMPTATION\u2019s sixth studio album since their 1997 debut, Hydra showcases their fastest & most powerful material. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked back over our past albums and taken different elements that we like and brought them back for Hydra,\u201d explains WITHIN TEMPTATION vocalist Sharon den Adel. \u201cWe had death metal growls on Enter, but we\u2019ve never used them again \u2013 until now. It\u2019s all about new blood and new ideas for us; we need changes in our music so that we can continue to explore in the future. We don\u2019t believe in boundaries.\u201d\n\n\nWITHIN TEMPTATION showed exactly what they meant by expanding their boundaries by debuting their collaboration with Finnish metal diva Tarja Turunen on the \u201cParadise(What About Us?)\u201d EP in September 2013. The track is based on the speech given by retired four-star general Peter van Uhm of the Royal Netherlands Army on May 4, 2013 (Dutch Liberation Day) next to theDutchNational Monument. \u201cHis speech made a deep impression on us,\u201d remembers den Adel. \u201cHis message being that the creation of a better world is only possible when you don\u2019t think about \u2018yourself\u2019 or \u2018them\u2019 but just think about \u2018us\u2019.\u201d And it appears the world responded in-kind. The \u201cParadise\u201d EP debuted at the #1 position on the iTunes Rock/Metal chart in the U.S. the week of its release and also clinched the #1 spot on the iTunes Rock chart in Finland, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and Greece. Additionally, it placed in the Top 5 in theU.K.,Germany,\n\n\nFrance,Norway,Switzerland,Austria, andBelgium. The official \u201cParadise(What About Us?)\u201d music video has amassed over 2.5 million views since its online debut. \u201cWe knew that Tarja\u2019s voice would give \u2018Paradise\u2019 extra power,\u201d recalls Westerholt. \u201cThe way she delivers those high melody lines left us all speechless. There is always a bit of tension created by people on the outside between different bands of the same genre, but we knew that this wouldn\u2019t come between us, and that we\u2019d be able to work together. We had a great time, and the fans responded beyond our expectations.\u201d\n\n\nProduced by Daniel Gibson, Hydra is set to reveal the full extent of WITHIN TEMPTATION\u2019s musical resurrection. An example of the album\u2019s wide range of musical styles, lyrical themes, and unconventionality is the guest vocal appearance by American hip-hop icon Xzibit, who raps on a song full of yearning, \u201cAnd We Run.\u201d \u201cXzibit is amazing!\u201d laughs Westerholt. \u201cHe\u2019s a very positive guy with a huge history: he came from a tough background and decided to make something of his life. This song is about how you\u2019ve got to live your life now. He\u2019s rapping at full force on this song, it\u2019s really heavy. We\u2019ve actually planned to have him on a WITHIN TEMPTATION album for a long time, but we never had the right song for him until now. He was perfect because we wanted a real rapper with a deep voice because that would complementSharon\u2019s vocals. He really delivered!\u201d\n\n\nSharonadds: \u201cWe like Xzibit\u2019s lyrics so we gave him the freedom to write whatever he wanted and he came up with some amazing lines for this song. He brings a new element to WITHIN TEMPTATION that we\u2019ve never had before! It's a new cross-over and we love it! \u201d\n\n\nAnother soon-to-be fan favorite is \u201cSilver Moonlight,\u201d which Westerholt describes as \u201cthe opposite of a love song. It\u2019s about how people have hunted down other people they didn\u2019t understand through the ages, using the metaphor of werewolves. I did some death metal growls and screams on this song. It\u2019s been a long time since I did those, and as soon as I started recording them, I realized why I stopped singing that way... It really hurts! It was fun to do them again, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDangerous\u201d was recorded with the former Killswitch Engage and current Devil You Know singer Howard Jones, whose gallant vocals are a perfect fit for den Adel. \u201cI always loved Howard\u2019s voice,\u201d she shares. \u201cHe makes the song even heavier than it already is. It\u2019s one of our favorite songs on the record and one of the fastest songs we\u2019ve ever written. It has the most bass drums we\u2019ve ever used, too, and a very fast riff which we doubled with synths. It\u2019s not a typical synthesizer, though \u2013 it\u2019s distorted like a guitar, and it\u2019s very aggressive.\u201d\n\n\nThe darkest depths of the human condition are explored in songs such as \u201cCovered By Roses\u201d which Westerholt reveals was inspired by the poet John Keats\u2019 \u201cOde On Melancholy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about the mortality of beauty. Keats said that all beauty must die.\u201d On the inspiration for \u201cTell Me Why?\u201dSharonsays: \u201cA traumatic experience recently happened to a close friend of mine. These losses can make you doubt the relevance of a lot of things, and you ask yourself why you\u2019re still here. I think that people in many different situations will relate to it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhole World Is Watching\u201d features Soul Asylum\u2019s golden-voiced singer Dave Pirner. \u201cI remember when I first heard the song \u2018Runaway Train,\u2019\u201d recallsSharon. \u201cI was travelling throughIndiaand I saw the video on MTV Asia. Dave\u2019s voice and lyrics just blew me away. The impact of that song combined with the images ofIndianever left me. When we wrote \u2018Whole World Is Watching,\u2019 Dave was at the top of our list. He has such a captivating voice: it made the song exactly how it needed to be. It\u2019s about overcoming setbacks in life; after all, those are what create you. It feels as if the whole world is with you when these things happen. It\u2019s an optimistic song, but dramatic at the same time.\u201d\n\n\nHydra goes from strength to strength with its ten tracks, drawing you in, digging deeper, and then letting you go. Westerholt sums it up this way: \u201cThis album is about the big things in life and in the world today. We still have our symphonic elements, but it\u2019s much faster and heavier than The Unforgiving. It\u2019s dark, and powerful. It goes in completely different directions \u2013 hence the title Hydra, because it represents the different sides of us.\u201dSharonconcurs: \u201cIt\u2019s the best of old and new. Hydra really shows the multiple personalities of WITHIN TEMPTATION. We looked back to our previous work and forward to our future, and we combined those things to make the album.\u201d\n\n\nOn its February 4thU.S.release date, Hydra was the #1 best-selling album on both the iTunes Rock and iTunes Metal charts. Hydra held down the #1 spot on the iTunes Metal chart and #1 on Amazon\u2019s Hard Rock & Metal chart for two weeks in a row. The album debuted at #16 on the American Billboard Top 200 Albums chart its first week, marking the band\u2019s first appearance in the Billboard Top 20. It also secured the #1 position on both the Billboard Top Independent Albums & the Billboard Top Hard Music Albums charts.\n\n\nAt college radio, Hydra had the highest chart debut of the week ranking in the Top 5 on the CMJ Loud Rock chart.\n\n\nInEurope, Hydra debuted at #1 in The Netherlands and The Czech Republic. It also secured the #2 position inSwitzerland&Finland, #4 inGermany, #6 in theU.K.- the band\u2019s highest entry in that territory to date, and #9 inFrance.\n\n\nUndefeatable!\n\n\nWITHIN TEMPTATION MUSICIANS\n\n\nSharon den Adel \u2013 Lead Vocals \u2022 Robert Westerholt - Guitars Ruud Jolie - Guitars \u2022 Stefan Helleblad \u2013 Live Touring Guitarist Jeroen Van Veen \u2013 Bass \u2022 Martijn Spierenburg \u2013 Keyboards Mike Coolen \u2013 Drums\n\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\n\nHydra, 2014 (Nuclear Blast) \u2022 The Unforgiving, 2011 (Roadrunner) The Heart Of Everything, 2007 (Roadrunner) \u2022 The Silent Force, 2004 (Sony) Mother Earth, 2000 (DSFA) \u2022 Enter, 1997 (DSFA)\n\n\nCountry of Origin: TheNetherlands\n\n\nOfficial Website: www.WITHIN-TEMPTATION.com\n\n\nLike: www.facebook.com/WTOFFICIAL\n\n\nFollow: twitter.com/WTOFFICIAL\n\n\nWatch: www.YouTube.com/WTOFFICIAL",

In cases where a prescriptive-based \r\napproach would not properly address stakeholder design objectives, \r\nperformance-based methods may be prudently employed to provide a rational \r\nbasis for determining if the structural system can meet the required \r\nperformance objectives for uncontrolled fire events.\u00a0 For example, \r\nperformance-based methods may be required as part of building code \r\nvariances in order to demonstrate the adequacy of innovative and/or \r\nnonconventional design. This approach also provides opportunities to \r\ndevelop designs that are optimized for aesthetics, functionality, and/or \r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://sghsfseminar.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebapi&aff=aff0hangtime",

Panel discussions will follow the films.\r\n\r\nFilms are free, but registration is required.\r\n\r\nHome is a particularly timely and poignant subject, given San Francisco\u2019s \r\ncurrent housing shortage, the rapid expansion of cities all over the world, \r\nand the shifting roles of planners and architects in multi-family and \r\nsingle-family housing. In this series, we see different shapes and types of \r\nhome, and along with it, different meanings of home. The films explore the \r\nidea of home as a high-rise apartment, the American Dream, a mansion, a \r\nnever-ending renovation, a romantic notion, and even a whole city.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Versailles (2012)\r\n\r\nSeptember 24, 5:30 pm\r\n\r\nwww.magpictures.com/thequeenofversailles\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Versailles is a humorous but sobering view of the \r\n\u00fcber-American dream: a family decides to build the largest and most \r\nexpensive single-family house in the United States during the recent \r\neconomic recession. The film regards the changing shape of the American \r\ndream, particularly with respect to home ownership and its financial and \r\nemotional costs.\r\n\r\nRunning time:\u00a0100 min.\r\n\r\nDirected by Lauren Greenfield\r\n\r\nThe evening will include a short film, Big House (Al Bayt Al Kabeer)\r\n(2014), directed by Musa Syeed. Running time: 5 min.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOther Films during the Festival:\r\n\r\nMr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948) \u00a0September 3, 5:30 pm\r\n<http://ac14filmseries1.eventbrite.com>\r\n\r\nOyler House\u00a0(2012)\u00a0|\u00a0September 10, 5:30 pm\r\n<http://ac14filmseries2.eventbrite.com>\r\n\r\nDetropia\u00a0(2012)\u00a0|\u00a0September 17, 5:30 pm\r\n<http://ac14filmseries4.eventbrite.com>\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbout the Film Series Curator\r\n\r\nCatherine Nueva Espa\u00f1a has been a volunteer member of the AIASF \r\nCommunications Committee since 2008.

        "description": "\u00a0\r\nWhat happens when an acclaimed memoirist sits down for a conversation with \r\nhis mother?\r\n\r\nJoin us for a conversation with author Sean Wilsey, who captured the \r\ncuriosity of life as a San Francisco society child in his 2005 memoir Oh \r\nthe Glory of it All. Wilsey, an avid skateboarder and boarding school \r\nwayfarer, chronicled a youth spent in and out of San Francisco\u2019s upper \r\nechelons with what the New York Times described as a \u201cvivid mix of brio, \r\nself-awareness and sophistication.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn Wilsey\u2019s new collection of essays, More Curious, the author paints a \r\ncompelling picture of an America he found to be \u201cmuch kinder and less \r\nhomogenous\u201d than he feared. More Curious spans fifteen years of Wilsey\u2019s \r\nwork and includes musings on life in rural Texas, what soccer and religion \r\nhave in common, and the state of skateboarding \u2014 and American culture \u2014 \r\ntoday. Other essays include those previously published in GQ, McSweeney\u2019s, \r\nThe New York Times Magazine, National Geographic, Fast Company, and Vanity \r\nFair.\r\n\r\nJoin Wilsey as he discusses More Curious, the power of place, and memoir as \r\ncatharsis. Wilsey will be joined in conversation by his mother, non-fiction \r\nauthor and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Pat Montandon.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilsey is able here to convey his feelings earnestly...with the same \r\nvividness and immediacy he brings to his descriptions of people, places and \r\nthings.\r\nThe New York Times\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhether Sean Wilsey\u2019s subject is rats, NASA, or a surreal road trip across \r\nAmerica, the writing is animated and diverse, dappled with literary \r\noddities and enlivened, always, by his eye for the absurd.\r\nJennifer Egan\r\n\r\n <http://www.greenapplebooks.com/>\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n\nhttps://seanwilsey.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebapi&aff=aff0hangtime",

Before touring the globe and amassing \r\nmillions of hits online with his series of beloved tracks and mixes, the \r\nyoung man came up as a true disciple, absorbing hip hop and RnB culture \r\nsince his childhood and finding ways to make the music his own.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSince the age of fourteen, when he first began to DJ and the following year \r\nwhen his brother introduced him to music production software, his output \r\nhas been relentless. As he explains, \u201cafter he showed me the basics, from \r\nthat day on I couldn\u2019t stop making beats,\u201d pumping out a beat a day for the \r\nnext couple of years and soon after self-releasing a series of EPs and beat \r\ntapes that quickly began to expand his reach. Official releases on HW&W and \r\nJakarta Records soon spread his name like wildfire and some instant-classic \r\nremixes by the likes of Missy Elliot, Janet Jackson, TLC, Danny Brown and \r\nothers have cemented his reputation and his sound; an undeniable swing of \r\nthe drums comparable to Dilla\u2019s, a signature soulful touch in the melodies, \r\nand a healthy dose of funky bass lines.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the past year, he was approached by Brodinski to drop the single \u201cFree \r\nThings In Life\u201d on the hotly-tipped French label Bromance, has headlined \r\ntours in Europe, Australia and North America, and released his newest \r\nsingle and video \u201cAt All\u201d which has already conquered dance floors \r\nworldwide and introduced his face to the world with an unforgettable video. \r\nNow, as he continues to bridge the gap between the dance world and hip \r\nhop/RnB, he is prepping a solo album for 2014 and a series of high profile \r\ncollaborations that will confirm his position as one of the most important \r\nproducers in today\u2019s musical landscape.\r\n\u00a0 <http://po.st/Kaytranada1>\r\nKAYTRANADA - AT ALL (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\u00a0// 485,033 views on YouTube\r\n\u00a0\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTickets: After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an \r\nemail with your tickets attached as a PDF.

In San \r\nFrancisco alone, there are an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people sleeping on \r\nthe streets, in cars and other unsuitable places, or in shelters every \r\nnight. Many of these vulnerable people are children, seniors or those \r\nafflicted by physically or mentally disabling conditions \u2013 in fact, \r\nfamilies are one of the fastest growing segments of the homeless \r\npopulation, causing devastating effects on the development of young \r\nchildren. This crisis is devastating to the people who endure it and \r\naffects the quality of life of everyone in our city. It requires a \r\npermanent, integrated solution designed by the people who have first-hand \r\nknowledge of the issue.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1990, Community Housing Partnership is the only San Francisco \r\nnonprofit organization exclusively dedicated to providing supportive \r\nhousing to formerly homeless individuals and families. Community Housing \r\nPartnership pairs affordable housing with support services, employment \r\npreparation, job training, a transitional employment social enterprise, and \r\ncommunity organizing activities. Together these services offer clients a \r\ndirect pathway from homelessness to self-sufficiency. Community Housing \r\nPartnership utilizes safe, stable housing as a platform to deliver services \r\nto clients which result in increased self-sufficiency. Community Housing \r\nPartnership owns, manages, or provides services at 13 buildings with over \r\n1,000 units and has 222 units development. Community Housing Partnership\u2019s \r\nhousing and services annually impact the lives of over 2,200 formerly \r\nhomeless adults and children.\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/whiskey-tasting-benefit-community-housing-partnership-tickets-12698237771?ref=ebapi&aff=aff0hangtime",

Users access a service through \"service \r\navatars:\" devices, apps, websites, even paper forms and in-person \r\ninteractions. Visionary author and founder of Adaptive Path Mike Kuniavsky \r\nwill discuss how to design devices for multi-touchpoint services, why and \r\nwhen to use specialized devices to create a competitive advantage and how \r\nto design different touchpoints simultaneously so each provides specific \r\nuser value and creates a consistent experience across the service as a \r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker: Mike Kuniavsky leads user experience design in the \r\nInnovation Services Group at PARC, a Xerox company. A twenty-year veteran \r\nof digital product development, he designs products, business processes, \r\nand services at the leading edge of technological change. Prior to PARC, \r\nMike co-founded several successful user experience centered companies, \r\nincluding ThingM, which designs and manufactures ubiquitous computing and \r\nIoT products, and Adaptive Path, a well-known design consultancy. He has \r\nworked with top technology companies, such as Samsung, Sony, Nokia, \r\nWhirlpool, and Qualcomm, to design new products, guide product strategy, \r\nand create user-centered design and development cultures.

We\u2019ll also work together to specify time \r\nhorizons for educational transformation: what needs to happen in the near \r\nterm, mid term, and long term to create a better future for education? \r\nThen, we will explore how to move from vision to action by mapping our \r\npersonal roles in shaping the future of education. In a nutshell, that\u2019s \r\nfuture mapping!\r\n\r\nDrawing inspiration from visionary educators like Paulo Freire and projects \r\nsuch as the Russian Education Foresight Initiative, MEEP\u2019s method for \r\nfuture mapping honors the curiosity and expertise of all people and \r\nhighlights the role we all play in shaping the learning ecosystem, now and \r\nfor the future!\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s an educational ecosystem?

In this series we will be showcasing some of those \r\nyoung leaders that are part of the engine that keeps this city going \r\nthrough their amazing work. These talented individuals come from very \r\ndifferent backgrounds and fulfill diverse roles in the organizations they \r\nwork for. This is the perfect opportunity to learn from their experiences \r\nand entrepreneurial spirit.\r\nJames Beshara has been deeply focused on collaborative funding and the \r\nimportant opportunity it presents for global development since 2007. Before \r\nco-founding Tilt in 2012, James studied Development Economics at Wake \r\nForest University, and went on to become a research fellow in Africa. While \r\nin Africa, James built dvelo.org, an online lending platform for investors \r\nto loan small sums to capital-constrained microfinance institutions in \r\ndeveloping countries. From 2007 to 2009, Dvelo.org raised resources for \r\ncommunities on three continents.\r\nThrough his undergraduate research and work experience, James developed a \r\nstrong belief in the potential for civic crowdfunding, envisioning a world \r\nthat could be positively transformed through the power of shared resources, \r\nwhere communities could organize financially to define their environments. \r\nIn 2012, he co-founded Tilt, a website for people to collect, fundraise or \r\npool money with their groups - to save a local toy store, send the Jamaican \r\nBobsled team to the Olympics, or help fulfill the wish of a Gold Star \r\nchild.\r\nJames aspires to bring Tilt to developing countries, where combined with \r\nsmartphone penetration and digital currency, crowdfunding could transform \r\ncommunities that have been hampered by a lack of basic infrastructure.\r\nJames is an accomplished fly-fisherman and an amateur stand-up comedian.\r\nJames will be in conversation with Benjamin Muessig, Business Editor for \r\nthe SF Chronicle.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nOur Partner <http://www.sfchronicle.com/>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n___\r\n\r\nCan't make it?

Badlands are known for having spectacular color displays that \r\nalternate from dark black and blue to bright red clay.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition uses the physical and philosophical associations of \r\nbadlands as a jumping off point to explore the human body as a metaphorical \r\nlandscape. Both the human body and the natural world instigate paradoxical \r\nreactions, such as desire and horror, beauty and fear.\r\n\r\nBadlands frames the body as a a place where materials, artistic practices, \r\nand human identities converge in examining the holes, the disruptions, and \r\nthe fissures of our physical existence.\r\n\r\nParticipating Artists\r\n\r\nKatherine Vetne\r\nAaron Kissman\r\nShannon Miya\r\nHayley Sutton\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\r\n\r\nGet the latest news about the artists, real-time updates leading up to the \r\nevent, and see who else is attending Badlands\r\n<http://sfai.edu/events-calendar/detail/badlands> .\r\n\r\nShare on Twitter <https://twitter.com/SFAIevents> @SFAIevents + Instagram\r\n<http://instagram.com/sanfranciscoartinstitute> @sanfranciscoartinstitute \u00bb \r\n#SFAI\n\nhttps://swellbadlands.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebapi&aff=aff0hangtime",

An emerging titan in the studio and \r\nsimply electrifying in the booth, support comes from all possible corners \u2013 \r\nArmin Van Buuren, Skrillex, Avicii, Tiesto, Above & Beyond, Axwell, SHM, \r\nDirty South, Porter Robinson and more join the plethora of press touting \r\nARTY as one of the biggest rising stars of recent years.From broadcasting \r\nbehemoths MTV and Sirius XM and music bible Rolling Stone through to \r\ninfluential tastemakers Dancing Astronaut and beyond, watch ARTY build on \r\nthis in 2012 as he continues to forge his path and takes his place amongst \r\nthe dance music elite.The gifted youngster first lit up airwaves and dance \r\nfloors back in 2009 with tracks such as \u2018Gentle Touch\u2019, \u2018Get On\u2019 and \u2018Flip \r\nFlop\u2019. Quickly snapped up by the legendary Anjunabeats imprint, his \r\nrelationship with the team behind Above & Beyond has only gone from \r\nstrength to strength over the last three years. Explosive anthems have \r\nproved to be the norm for Arty; \u2018Kate\u2019, \u2018Around The World\u2019, the \r\nAxtone-signed \u2018Trio\u2019 and the explosive Mat Zo collaboration \u2018Mozart\u2019 being \r\nthe mere tip of a rapidly expanding musical iceberg. Consistently featured \r\nin the sets of the world\u2019s biggest artists and on its most far-reaching \r\nradio stations, it came as no surprise then that 2011\u2019s DJ Mag Top 100 DJ \r\nPoll saw ARTY soar a staggering 50+ places to claim the #25 spot.It\u2019s not \r\njust his continual onslaught of production work that sealed the deal for \r\nthe army of ARTY fans who put their money where their mouth is and \r\ndelivered votes in their droves. Whether it\u2019s deep in the darkened, \r\nthundering bosom of clubland or in front of tens of thousands on the \r\nlaser-lit stages of Ultra Music Festival, Identity Festival, Electric Zoo \r\nFestival, Fallout Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival and more, his spell- \r\nbinding sets have cemented his status as one of the most sought after \r\nartists anywhere. From the US and Canada through to South America, across \r\nthe seas to the shores of Europe, Asia and beyond to Australia, this hot \r\ntalent has grabbed the attention of both the new EDM generation and those \r\nmore seasoned veterans of the dance arena. The chant seized on by fans says \r\nit all; there is \u201cno party without ARTY\u201d. And the success continues across \r\nthe board. In June 2012, ARTY announced the beginning of a new partnership \r\nwith Stateside radio giant Sirius XM. Joining the elite ranks of DJs to \r\nhave hosted exclusive shows on the network, ARTY\u2019s \u2018Together We Are\u2019 will \r\nbeam directly into the ears of a waiting America. \u2018Open Space\u2019, released on \r\nAnjunabeats in June, scored huge radio play and an overwhelming tidal wave \r\nof support from the likes of David Guetta, Axwell, Armin Van Buuren, \r\nTiesto, Hardwell, Thomas Gold, Gareth Emery, Ferry Corsten, Kaskade, Max \r\nVangeli and more. As ARTY\u2019s profile continues to grow, as more and more \r\ntune in to his sound, the only question is how far and how high this young \r\ntalented artist can go.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTerms and Conditions:\r\nThis event is 21 and over. Any Ticket holder unable to present valid \r\nidentification indicating that they are at least 21 years of age will not \r\nbe admitted to this event, and will not be eligible for a refund.\r\n\r\nSupport lineup subject to change. No refunds will be issued for lack of \r\nidentification or invalid identification.\r\nFashionable Attire is required, no sneakers, shorts, tank tops, baseball \r\nhats or gym clothes.\r\nBy purchasing a ticket, you will also receive weekly email blasts from Ruby \r\nSkye about upcoming events, guest lists and more.\n\nhttp://www.eventbrite.com/e/arty-tickets-12976463953?aff=aff0hangtime",

If you made it, grew \r\nit, harvested it, or foraged for it and it's edible, you can trade it! We \r\nsuggest portion sizes between 4\u201316 oz, depending on the cost of the \r\nmaterials involved.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow does the swapping work? All you need to do is bring 5-10 items (though \r\nsome people bring more, some less), which can range from a jar of last \r\nseason's jam to a loaf of bread you baked that day.

In these establishments \r\nhe discovered and honed his unique blending of material and crowd \r\ninteraction that makes no two of his performances the same. Phil\u2019s style \r\ncan best be described as unpredictably reflective, delivered with sharp \r\naccuracy, and rooted in the grand tradition of joke-telling.\r\n\r\nPhil\u2019s performances at The 2008 Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal \r\nbrought him international acclaim. His jokes were recognized in the \r\nMontreal Gazette\u2019s annual \"Best jokes of the Festival\". He was also named \r\none of the five comics creating a buzz at the festival by The Hollywood \r\nReporter and rewarded with a featured segment on The Tonight Show with Jay \r\nLeno. He has also appeared at the Halifax Comedy Festival, Global\u2019s \r\nVancouver International Comedy Fest, XFM satellite radio, and his own \r\ntelevision special on CTV and Comedy Network \u2013 he also won the 2007 \r\n\"Vancouver\u2019s Funniest comic\" competition.\r\n\r\nSince arriving in the States, Phil has appeared on \u201cThe Late Late Show With \r\nCraig Ferguson\u201d twice. In 2012, he returned to Just For Laughs for a second \r\ntime and he was selected for the Comics-To-Watch Showcase as part of the \r\nNew York Comedy Festival. Phil can currently be seen on your television, in \r\na Microsoft commercial alongside Samantha Bee and Jason Jones of \"The Daily \r\nShow\".\r\n\r\nAll shows are 18 & over with valid photo ID.

This is best shown in his work \r\nfor Preservation Hall\u2019s release King Britt presents Sister Gertrude Morgan, \r\nwhich combined, the gospel evangelist\u2019s vocal recordings from 1970 with \r\ncontemporary composition. This recording went on to penetrate the pop \r\nculture divide, by appearing in Michael Mann\u2019s Miami Vice and HBO\u2019s True \r\nBlood tv show, whose soundtrack was nominated for a Grammy. It was this and \r\nmany other projects from his vast catalog that helped him receive the Pew \r\nFellowship for Composition in 2007.\r\n\r\nHe has remixed and produced many diverse artists including Miles Davis, \r\nCurtis Mayfield, Radiohead, Alison Moyet, Everything But the Girl and Chic, \r\nas well as scoring commercials for Rolex and L\u2019oreal Paris.\r\n\r\nAs a performer, King is best known as one of the top globetrotting dj\u2019s in \r\nthe world. From cutting his craft as the wax poetic for the Grammy Award \r\nwinning Digable Planets to traveling solo to different cities and \r\ncountries, bringing cultures together through his eclectic taste and live \r\nimprovised dance/experimental sets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dj sets, he brings many projects from studio to the \r\nstage environment. These include, Sylk130 Collective (which sold over 500k \r\ncopies), Saturn Never Sleeps and The Sister Gertrude Experience, performing \r\nin spaces as diverse as The Whitney Museum, The Corcoran Gallery and Winter \r\nGarden in the NYC Financial Center. King has graced the stage at festivals \r\nwell, such as Kernel Festival (Italy), Moogfest (Asheville) , Glastonbury \r\n(UK), River to River (NYC), Camp Bisco (upstate NYC) and Voodoo Fest (New \r\nOrleans).\r\n\r\nAs a curator, he has done events for the Institute of Contemporary Art in \r\nPhiladelphia, Knitting Factory NYC and The Getty Museum. While in residence \r\nat The Painted Bride Arts Center in 2009, King brought leading\r\ninternational electronic music artists into projects and settings that they \r\nnormally are unaccustomed and creating new work. Recently remixing Merideth \r\nMonk, Saul Williams and King Sunny Ade, King continues to be an important \r\nforce in the shaping of contemporary music.\r\n\r\nHe is currently working on Dumni Songs with Tendai Maraire of Shabazz \r\nPalaces, that take the historic Zimbabwe recordings of Tendai\u2019s father\r\nDumni Maraire, the master of the Mbira, and combines them with contemporary \r\ncomposition and arrangements. This collaboration is set to be released in \r\n2013 with a live multimedia experience to accompany\r\n\r\nBROTHER IN ARMS (San Francisco, CA)\r\n\r\n(Biography)\r\n\r\nBrother In Arms is crafting the soundtrack to your next evening and you \r\ndidn't even know it yet. A natural collaboration between San \r\nFrancisco-based friends/DJ\u2019s/Producers J Boogie and Deejay Theory, the \r\nwell-seasoned duo come loaded with vibes ready to light up nightclubs, \r\nbeachfronts and fireplaces in 2014. Blending equal parts slowed house, deep \r\ndisco and modern and classic R&B, their sound would be something like Grace \r\nJones making love to Todd Terje \u2014 and we're not mad at that.\r\n\r\nBIA saw their first endeavor on a limited edition 12\" via Whiskey Disco, as \r\nwell as official remixes on Heavy Roc for DJ Equal, and Win Music for Eric \r\nSharp ft. Anna Lunoe. Debut performances as a DJ duo have included support \r\nfor Oliver, Danny Daze, Classixx, Moon Boots, Poolside, Jimmy Edgar, Doctor \r\nDru, Lazaro Casanova, B Bravo, Walker & Royce and more.

Previous works were included on David Heartbreak's \r\nacclaimed \"Moombahsoul\" compilations, as well as regular DJ sets at their \r\nresident \"Night Moves\" party w/ partner PAPA LU.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHAWTHORN is located at 46 Geary St. In San Francisco just north of Market & \r\n3rd St. right around the corner from HAKASAN\r\n\r\n21 & UP w/ valid ID\n\nhttp://sexdisco.eventbrite.com/?aff=aff0hangtime",

        "description": "The UK duo, known for their sensational disco and psychedelic edits, obscenely vast record collections, beautiful production work and transcendent mixtape journeys, are being heralded as a truly unique and positive presence in today's music scene.\r\n\r\n\"Fucking Brilliant\" \u00ac DJ Mag\r\n\r\nAlthough Tom and Danny have both been utterly immersed in music since time itself began, Psychemagik's first appearance on wax was an edit of Fleetwood Mac's 'Everywhere', which quickly found its way into the record bags of veterans like Tom Middleton and Greg Wilson, and instantly cemented their place in the disco music world. The duo have since released a string of highly acclaimed edits, original productions and remixes.\r\n\r\nThey regularly play at major festivals, clubs and special events all over the UK and Europe \u2013 with tours in the USA and Australia set for 2013.\r\n\r\n\"An ear for mind-expanding dance floor mysticism\" \u00ac\u2013 FACT Magazine\r\n\r\nTheir studio output is prolific to say the least; Valley Of Paradise, the first single from their debut album, sold out on pre-orders and was followed by a slew of incredible remixes from the likes of Greg Wilson, Time and Space Machine, Toby Tobias and Rayko and received critical acclaim and airplay worldwide. Recent remix projects include Azari & III, Metronomy, Kraak and Smaak, Crystal Fighters, Yacht, Time and Space Machine, The Egg, Skinny Lister and The Cuban Brothers.\r\n\r\n\"Remixers du jour\" \u2013 Mixmag\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the edits. Their recent version of Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams', a follow up to 'Everywhere', topped the Hype Machine charts and has been gaining some serious props from around the globe. They have also released a string of edits on their Healin' Feelin and Discotheque Wreckers imprints, all of which have made it into the Juno top sellers list.\r\n\r\nTheir mixes paint the story of two extraordinarily talented and passionate guys. Some blatantly show that Psychemagik can absolutely dominate a dancefloor. Others, like their guest mixes for the Test Pressing podcast, are gorgeously composed psychedelic experiences, which give you an idea of just how deep and amazing their record collections really are. Basically, you can bet that they have the perfect record for any time and any place.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly deconstructed Hot Chip's sound for their support slot\u2026Fantastic\"\r\n\r\n\u2013 Songkick\r\n\r\nThey also have a reputation as the go to guys for mega rare records you won't find anywhere else. Their satisfied customers include 2 Many Dj's/Soulwax, Chemical Brothers, Q-Tip, Fake Blood amongst many others.\r\n\r\nIt is this incredible ear for musical treasures and their dedication to the art of digging that has lead to the success of their recent compilation, Psychemagik Presents: 'Magik Cyrkles' on Leng Records, which sold out worldwide on vinyl within 48 hours of its release and went straight to number one in the Juno bestsellers chart on CD. With a wealth of upcoming releases and their debut studio LP just around the corner, they've already set the controls for the heart of the sun and will be heading into a whole new stratosphere of creativity in 2013.",

        "description": "Snowmine are set to release their new album \u2013 Dialects \u2013 through their own imprint Mystery Buildings. Dialects, Snowmine's second album in their three year history, was entirely written and produced on their own, and recorded by Jake Aron (Grizzly Bear), and Yale Yng Wong (Here We Go Magic) in a church in Uptown Manhattan. The album chronicles a disoriented period in singer Grayson Sanders' life, when after the band's first record, he spontaneously left his job, and spent the following year wandering with a single bag. The lyrics are pulled entirely from the journal he kept during his travels. Dialects is about communication. With the self. With the lover. With society. It's about its breakdown, it's triumphs, and it's misgivings. Growing off of the band's previous release, Dialects marks a subtle shift in the band's sound, from the optimistic, tribal undertones of Laminate Pet Animal, to a more ambient, meditative nostalgia. Recording in a church afforded them the opportunity to record real reverbs, and gather true ambiances one can feel in their headphones. Combine a stronger presence of vintage synthsesizers with the beautiful 1960's cinema-inspired string, woodwind, and choir orchestrations, and you are left with a surreal retrofuturism beckoning you inside for a fireside chat.",

        "description": "When it came time for the Dodos to begin writing their fifth LP, Carrier, singer/guitarist Meric Long wanted to start over.\r\nThe uncertainty of the band's trajectory as well as the passing of guitarist Chris Reimer brought about a reassessment of things within the band, and in particular Long's songwriting.\r\n\r\nIn need of a different vantage point, Long began writing words before music for the first time, enveloping himself in silence rather than sound.\r\n\r\nWhen it came time to set these lyrics to music, Long started writing with only his electric guitar in hand \u2014 another first. The focus on this instrument was due in large part to the time Long spent with Reimer, the guitarist for Women who had joined Long and percussionist Logan Kroeber to become the third member of the Dodos throughout 2011 before unexpectedly passing away early the following year.\r\n\r\n\"Chris was a huge influence on the way I think about guitar, songwriting, and music in general,\" reveals Long. \"Seeing how he could transform and shape sound with an electric guitar inspired me to explore more tones and use those tones to begin writing a song.\"\r\nAnd so, when he began to formulate the tracks that would ultimately comprise Carrier, Long employed two principles he inherited from Reimer: patience to let a song develop and a judgment-free enthusiasm for sound.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Long and Kroeber decided to record in their hometown of San Francisco for the first time, allowing for less time constraints and a more pressure-free experience than past out-of-state sessions had afforded.\r\n\r\nAlthough John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone studio was initially selected for its analog-friendly set-up, the duo were happy to find themselves working within a supportive community of like-minded musicians that included engineers Jay and Ian Pellicci, both of whom assisted in the production of Carrier, as well as the Magik Magik Orchestra, which appears on several tracks.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the album the Dodos crafted is refreshingly sincere: no computers, no gimmicks \u2014 just eleven songs that are beautiful and solid and true and honest.\r\n\r\n\"Substance\" effortlessly embodies all of these traits, from the crisp drumming that announces its arrival to the bright guitar lines that weave in and out before eventually joining forces with a triumphant burst of trumpets.\r\n\r\n\"Confidence\" begins like a calm before the storm, its strong vocals over gentle guitar and drums soon erupting into a positively epic display of guitar riffs and hypnotizing percussion.\r\n\r\nThe record's second side is anchored by \"The Current,\" on which an angular guitar tone loops over a chugging guitar rhythm to satisfying effect as Long declares in a moment of catharsis, \"If this love comes unto me / I'm with it / I'm with it.\"\r\n\r\nMuch too soon, Carrier ends with \"The Ocean\" \u2014 though Long and Kroeber view the track less as a conclusion and more of a \"to be continued\" into this album's follow-up, which they have already begun working on.\r\n\r\nFor a band briefly in flux, it's clear now that the Dodos' outlook on the future has never looked more certain.",

        "description": "A longtime collector of music, Recondite had his first experience with drum machines and hardware synths just a few years ago in a small studio next to the forest in lower Bavaria. It wasn't long after that he moved to Berlin to build up Plangent Records, where the artist rapidly established his name. Plangent #001 was well-received, and with three strong EPs released in 2011, he grabbed the attention of Scuba, who included \"Backbone\" in his DJ KiCKS mix and quickly put out two Recondite remixes on Hot Flush.\r\nOn Acid, his full-length debut, was delivered in 2012 via the sleek Los Angeles imprint, Acid Test. The Absurd Recordings sublabel had already featured revered releases from Donato Dozzy and Tin Man, and Recondite's LP garnered a great deal of positive feedback from the press and major producers alike.\r\nContinuing to release on his own Plangent series, he also put out the EC10 EP on Dystopian in early 2013 - a record that's as tough as it is experimental. Progressively, this all lead up to his sophomore LP and first release on Ghostly International, Hinterland. The record acknowledges the finests moments in his previous releases, and ultimately creates what he believes is something that captures the personality of Rottal-Inn - a district in southeastern Bavaria, Germany and his hometown.\r\nIt is easy to agree that Recondite has been playing his cards right. His earlier releases on Plangent were strong, and lead him to release with an assortment of labels that have drawn attention to his productions from a variety of audiences. With a growing demand from international bookings, Hinterland - out in (month) 2013 on Ghostly International - continues his ongoing streak of carefully crafted output.",

        "description": "Thirty years ago, Kyle Hollingsworth set out on a career in music.  With a wealth of desire and an abundance of ability, Hollingsworth has established himself as a formidable and versatile music talent deftly able to contribute, collaborate, compose, and communicate on a number of levels and within a vast spectrum of musical environments. Today, as a member of acclaimed jam masters The String Cheese Incident, Hollingsworth is revered by both peers and fans for his ability to write and perform in a mosaic of styles, from rock to classical, ragtime to bebop. Playing in SCI has allowed him unrestricted access to the world of music, and has bestowed on him the kind of fearlessness a composer needs to flirt with such disparate genres. Those who've seen SCI know that they can jerk from funk to bluegrass on a chord change. \"In the jam world, where there are no set ways of doing things, we're not afraid to move in and out of genres,\" he says, \"and because of that I've learned to be creative, not only onstage but in the studio. I can get on board with something pretty quickly. You have to.\"\r\n\r\nHis most recent release, titled Then There's Now, finds the musician coming in to his own. With solid song material and a slamming new band, Kyle is making his mark in the new, always-evolving music scene. Then There's Now delivers a blend of vocal and instrumental tunes and seamlessly displays his growth as a musician and as a songwriter.",

        "description": "It's not surprising that The Picturebooks recorded their 2014 album, Imaginary Horse [Riding Easy Records], in the same garage where they regularly refurbish and repair motorcycles and choppers. The German duo\u2014Fynn Claus Grabke [vocals, guitar] and Philipp Mirtschink [drums]\u2014capture a raw, rich, and real energy befitting of the room's natural reverb, industrial aura, and spiritual spark. Most importantly, the record also begins to rev up the boys' career like never before.\r\nFynn and Philipp first crossed paths at a local skate park. Becoming fast friends, they realized their mutual interests extended beyond shredding half-pipes and into music like The Smiths, The Cure, and Minor Threat. Soon, they began writing songs together, utilizing equipment Fynn's dad Claus had accumulated over his years as a musician and record producer.\r\nAfter two independent releases in Europe, the pair played major festivals such as Sziget and toured with everybody from International Noise Conspiracy to Spinnerette. Simultaneously, they garnered international attention for their motorcycle builds and received prominent profiles in tastemaker publications including DICE Magazine, Kustom, and many others.\r\nThey made their first trek to the United States in 2013. Following an explosive Hollywood gig supporting Eagles of Death Metal for DICE, they embarked on their inaugural North American tour and buzz began to organically spread through word of mouth and social media, specifically Twitter and Instagram. By the time they returned home, the group had inked a deal with Riding Easy Records.\r\nThe Picturebooks retreated to their \"garage\" in order to record Imaginary Horse during early 2014. Mirroring their daredevil skateboarding ethos, they broke rules while recording. For starters, there was considerable physical space between the musicians and the microphones, and it wasn't simply a sterile studio environment. The concrete floors and airy expanse contributed to the sound, and the overall atmosphere proved quite a propos.\r\n\"It really helped us formulate our style,\" declares Fynn. \"First of all, the studio is in the middle of nowhere. There are forests and fields around it. You can focus on making music without any distractions. Our goal was to come up with as unique of a sound as possible. We recorded everything in the garage with two mics next to our motorcycles fifteen feet away from us. I would basically sit on my chopper and sing. We got this incredible, real reverb. It was just awesome.\"\r\nIn fact, Fynn even sees quite a few similarities between building a rock song and a bike. He smiles, \"Coming from skateboarding and then making music, motorcycles were an extension from both of those pursuits. Building your own bike, you decide the colors, choose the bars, the engine, and the frame. It's like producing a song.\"\r\nThey even constructed their own instruments to boot. Fynn picked up thrift shop guitars in Los Angeles. Influenced by the tribal sounds of Native American music, the frontman built custom percussion and augmented his guitars with bells. Moreover, Philipp decided to eschew playing cymbals and adopted large Toms, which he bashes with mallets instead of sticks.\r\nThey conjured true fire in the garage with that astounding, untainted reverb and their personal arsenal of modified instruments. That fire pulsates through the first single \"Your Kisses Burn Like Fire\". A hulking beat gives way to a bluesy guitar twinge before Fynn howls the titular refrain.\r\n\"David Bowie used to write one word on a piece of paper, and then he'd put all of these words together to make lyrics,\" explains Fynn. \"I was really intrigued by that technique. This song came together in a similar way. Of course, there's a girl, and this feeling of being lost lyrically. That hurts, but it comes out in the performance.\"\r\nMeanwhile, the title track takes flight on that distorted hum and booming echo before slipping into psychedelic territory. \"I had an imaginary horse when I was a kid,\" the singer recalls. \"He was called Pon Pon, and he was with me all the time. He was that companion by my side. It was so crazy I had to write a song about him.\"\r\n\"PCH Diamond\" tells a vivid, cinematic tale of the band's time in Huntington Beach, CA at the Sun'n Sand Motel. Fynn's lyrics paint a picture of Southern California pulp as he recounts one night in particular.\r\n\"The Pacific Coast Highway is always the first place we go when we arrive from Germany,\" he says. \"It gives you this strange feeling. We spent three weeks at the hotel in Huntington, and so much happened. The lyrics are a story. I bought this diamond ring from a guy who told me he was a 'Shaman'. It was the cheapest piece of shit ever that I paid too much money for [Laughs]. However, you don't want to fuck around with a shaman so I bought it. It made for a good song subject!\"\r\nUltimately, all of these pieces form a blues rock pastiche that's as individualistic as it is infectious. The Picturebooks' Imaginary Horse becomes a reality for rock 'n' roll now.\r\n\"We never wanted to sound like anybody else,\" concludes Fynn. \"We've done everything possible to create something our own. I hope people see that, hear it, and feel it.\"",

Bristle, a quartet comprising McKean and Cory Wright on an assortment of reeds, plus Murray Campbell on violin and double reeds and bassist Lisa Mezzacappa, plays McKean and Wright\u2019s squirrely compositions that de-and re-construct familiar musical genres and pillage the farthest corners of jazz past and present. For this concert, McKean and Wright debut new pieces incorporating graphic scores and game strategies into the usual Bristle melange of composed and improvised elements.\n\nMazz Swift (NYC) \u2013 violin/vocals\nSilvia Bolognesi (Italy) \u2013 acoustic bass\nTomeka Reid (Chicago) \u2013 cello\n\nChicago based cellist, composer and educator, Tomeka Reid has been described as \u201ca remarkably versatile player,\u201d (Howard Reich, Chicago Tribune). Equally adept in classical and jazz contexts, Reid predominantly finds herself in experimental and improvisatory settings and composes for a wide range of instrumentation, from big band to chamber ensemble. She is an integral part of Dee Alexander\u2019s Evolution Ensemble, Nicole Mitchell\u2019s Black Earth Ensemble/Strings, Mike Reed\u2019s Loose Assembly and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) Great Black Music Ensemble. Reid performs with many of today\u2019s forward thinking musicians in the world of jazz and creative music including Anthony Braxton, George Lewis, Roscoe Mitchell, Jeb Bishop, Myra Melford, Fred Lonberg-Holm, Mary Halvorson, Denis Fournier, Edward Wilkerson and Harrison Bankhead. Ms. Reid has been commissioned by the AACM, the Chicago Jazz Festival and the Chicago Jazz Ensemble and has had several opportunities to showcase her work abroad at festivals such as Umbria Jazz, An Insolent Noise and Vignola Jazz.\n\nBassist, composer and arranger, Silvia Bolognesi graduated from the Institute R.Franci of Siena, Italy. She is the winner of the \u201cTop Jazz 2010\u2033 organized by Musica Jazz magazine. That same year, Bolognesi also won the trophy \u201cIn Sound\u201d in the double bass player category. Bolognesi is also the leader of several bands, including the Almond Tree and the Open Combo Octet.\n\nMazz Swift is a singer, composer and Juilliard-trained violinist who plays electric and acoustic instruments and has, over the years, performed and recorded with a diverse accumulation of artists including Whitney Houston, Perry Farrell, Dee Snider, James \u201cBlood\u201d Ulmer, Vernon Reid, Valerie June, DJ Logic, William Parker, Butch Morris, Jason Lindner, Kanye West and Jay-Z. In her own projects, Mazz combines elements of classical, folk, rock, jazz, free improvisational music and electronica \u2013 creating a rich, unique and diverse musical experience.\n\n\nBristle\n\nRandy McKean \u2013 alto sax, clarinets\nCory Wright \u2013 tenor sax, clarinets\nMurray Campbell \u2013 violin, oboes\nLisa Mezzacappa \u2013 acoustic bass\n\nBristle combines an intuitive chamber music sensibility with an off-kilter improvisational approach, seamlessly mixing fierce solo statements with intricate group textures in its pieces. The group explores the relation between written and open material, continually experimenting with popular song and through-composed forms. Wheezing accordions, errant looping machines, the kids\u2019 game Butts Up, typographic glyphs, Donkey Kong Level 3 (the one with the elevators) and Monty Python\u2019s Dead Parrot sketch all serve as inspirations for Bristle\u2019s compositions, as does individual members\u2019 past work with Yusef Lateef, Anthony Braxton, and Henry Threadgill. \u201cFresh, vibrant and unpredictable, starting with jaunty ditties or broad soundscapes but then pulling out the rug with outbursts of wild improv, abrupt changes in trajectory or gradual disintegration.\u201d \u2014 KZSU 90.1 fm",
